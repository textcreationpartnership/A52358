            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In the firſt, if the Wife's Heirs be only ſubſtitute Failȝieing Heirs of the Marriage, the Husband is underſtood to be Fiar; Becauſe as it is the eſſence of a Fee to have power to Diſpone, and if the Fiar do not Diſpone to tranſmit to the Fiars Heirs, and to be repreſented by them: And <hi>in dubio cujus haeredibus maxime proſpicitur,</hi> That perſon is thought to be Fiar.

The ſaid Eſtate is Diſponed to the Husband, and his Spouſe the longeſt Liver as ſaid is and their Heirs of the Marriage; and there is no Liferent ſettled on the Husband, whereas there is a Liferent of a part of the Lands given to his Wife in ſatisfaction of what might fall to her either of her Fathers Eſtate, or of her Husbands. 2do.

                        <p>If a Subvaſſal, to a Vaſſal holding of the King, be Forefaulted for Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; will ſubaltern Rights granted by him fall under Forefaulture?

Yet I think that theſe Rights ſhould fall, <hi>Quia reſoluto Jure Dantis reſolvitur Jus accipientis:</hi> And if the Subvaſſal ſhould Forefault his Lands by Recognition, his Vaſſals Right would Forefault: And it is againſt reaſon, That Treaſon being <hi>Crimen gravius,</hi> The Forefaulture and <hi>poena</hi> ſhould be <hi>Levior:</hi> And Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is <hi>Crimen feudale</hi> and againſt the King as Superior paramount: and as the betraying of a mediate Superior will import Forefaulture, not only of the Subvaſſal but of his Vaſſals; there is the ſame or greater reaſon, that Treaſon againſt the King ſhould have the ſame effect: and the reaſon that the Forefaulture of the Subvaſſal ſhould belong to the King is, becauſe the Crime is committed againſt him as higheſt Superior.</p>
                        <p>If the Kings immediat Vaſſal ſhould confirm the Inferior Rights, if there be any alteration of the caſe?

                        <p>If a perſon Infeft in Liferent be Forefaulted for Treaſon, will the Liferent expire though he ſurvive? Seing he is <hi>nullus,</hi> and after Treaſon doth neither tranſmitt <hi>cedendo</hi> nor <hi>delinquendo.</hi>

                        <p>The Royal Prerogative is acknowledged and aſſerted by diverſe Laws and Acts of Parliament of this Kingdom; But how far the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the ſame may reach, is a point of State and Policy of the higheſt nature and importance, and not to be defined by the Opinions of Lawyers, but by the Higheſt and Legiſlative Authority.</p>
                        <p>The Royal Prerogative is not only aſſerted in the general by the Laws of the Kingdom; but diverſe and great Powers Rights and Priviledges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing thereto, are in ſpecial declared by diverſe Acts of Parliament; both in Relation to the Government, and in Relation to His Majeſties In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and Queſtions, and Cauſes, betwixt Him and His Subjects; <hi>As the Power of Calling and Diſſolving Parliaments; The Choiſing and Appointing Officers of State, and Commiſſioners and Judges; To make War and Peace; And that there can be no Meetings to Treat or determine in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of State without His Majeſties Authority and Warrand: And that upon no pretence there can be any Riſing in Arms without His Warrand; And His Right to Cuſtums; And Power to grant Remiſſions for the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Crimes: And that the Negligence of His Officers cannot prejudge Him.</hi> And albeit by the Common Law the Eldeſt Superior is preferable, yet when Lands are holden of diverſe Superiors Ward, the Marriage of the Vaſſal, which otherwayes would belong to the Eldeſt Superior, doth pertain to the King, tho as to the Vaſſal his lateſt Superior: And by cuſtom, albeit the going to a Miln, for never ſo long a time, being <hi>facultatis,</hi> doth not import Servitude without a ſpecial Aſtriction, yet the repairing to His Majeſties Milns, by the ſpace of Fourty Years, doth induce a Servitude, without any other conſtitution: As to which and other points of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, explained by Law and Cuſtom, Lawyers may and ought to give their Opinions in Law.</p>

                        <p>IT being the Cuſtom of the Country in ſome places, That Lands con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of <hi>Graſs-Roums,</hi> are Yearly ſet from <hi>Whiteſunday</hi> to <hi>Whiteſunday</hi> thereafter, for payment of a Silver Duty at <hi>Martinmaſs</hi> after they are ſet; <hi>Quaeritur</hi> Therefore, If the Fiar ſurvive the <hi>Whiteſunday,</hi> but dieth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Martinmaſs,</hi> if he will have any part of the <hi>Martinmaſs</hi> Duty? Or if it will belong entirely to the Relict, Liferenter, or next Fiar? <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</hi> It is thought, That he nor his Executors would have no part of that Duty, being payed for the ſaid Year, betwixt <hi>Whiteſunday</hi> and the next enſueing <hi>Whiteſunday:</hi> Seing he deceaſed (as ſaid is) before <hi>Dies</hi> either <hi>ceſſit,</hi> or <hi>venit.

                           <pb n="178" facs="tcp:94635:98"/>In ſome places <hi>Graſs-Roums</hi> are ſet from <hi>Whiteſunday</hi> to <hi>Whiteſunday,</hi> but the Term of Payment is <hi>Candlemaſs,</hi> and <hi>Lambmaſs. Quaeritur,</hi> If the Fiar deceaſe after <hi>Martinmaſs</hi> after it is ſet, but before the firſt Term of Payment; if he will have any part of that Years Duty? <hi>Anſwer.</hi> It is thought, he will have the half; and what ever be the Term of Payment, <hi>Dies cedit</hi> at <hi>Martinmaſs,</hi> for the half Year preceeding.</p>
                        <p>Seing for the Duty of Corn-lands, though payable betwixt <hi>Yule</hi> and <hi>Candlemaſs,</hi> yet <hi>Dies cedit</hi> at <hi>Whiteſunday</hi> and <hi>Martinmaſs</hi> as in the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion foreſaid; <hi>Quaeritur,</hi> What is the reaſon of ſo great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt theſe and Graſs-Roums? <hi>Anſwer.</hi> That the Duty being payed for the Cropt, the Terms of <hi>Whiteſunday</hi> and <hi>Martinmaſs</hi> are reſpected; ſo that the Fiar ſurviving <hi>Whiteſunday,</hi> his Executors have Right to the half of the Year; upon that conſideration (as appears) becauſe the Lands are then fully laboured, and Sowen; and whoever ſurvives <hi>Martinmaſs</hi> has Right to that Terms Duty, becauſe the Cropt is then fully collected: But as to Graſs-Roums ſet, (as ſaid is) at <hi>Whiteſunday</hi> to <hi>Whiteſunday</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; the Graſs only is to be conſidered, which upon the matter is the Cropt of theſe Roums; and the reaſon why the Duty of the whole Year is payed at <hi>Martinmaſs,</hi> appears to be, that before <hi>Martinmaſs</hi> the Graſs-profites are collected by ſelling of their Wool and Beaſts, at or before that time.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Quaeritur,</hi> If the Fiar deceaſe after <hi>Martinmaſs</hi> and has not uplifted the Duty, will the ſame divide betwixt him and the Liferenter? And if he has uplifted the ſame, if his Executors would be Lyable to refound the half to the Liferenter? <hi>Anſwer, Cogitandum.</hi> For if it be not uplifted it appears reaſonable that the Liferenter ſhould have the half, and if it be uplifted, it appears hard that the Fiar having uplifted the ſame <hi>Jure ſuo &amp; bona fide,</hi> ſhould be Lyable to render any part of the ſame; ſpecially ſeing the Liferenter may have the ſame advantage if ſhe ſhould deceaſe after <hi>Martinmaſs.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If Corn Roums ſhould be ſet in the ſame Terms, That the Duty ſhould be payed at <hi>Martinmaſs</hi> after they are ſet, <hi>Quid Juris?</hi> Seing the ſaid payment will be before the next Cropt, and the Fiar may die before both the Terms of the next Year, for which the Duty is due? <hi>Anſwer.</hi> It is thought, that the Fiar cannot ſet the ſaid Lands in manner foreſaid, in prejudice of the Liferenter: And if the Tennent take the ſame that way, it is upon his own hazard: And the Liferenter would force him to pay the Duty, after the ordinary Terms of the Country.</p>

                           <hi>Quaeritur,</hi> If a Tennent have a Liferent-Tack, and he Die after <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunday,</hi> If the Tack will not continue for that Year? Seing the time of Removing of Goods neceſſary for labouring is paſt before his deceaſe, and Roums being ſet from <hi>Whiteſunday</hi> to <hi>Whiteſunday, annus coeptus,</hi> as to La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring, <hi>habetur pro completo.

                        <p>As to the Priviledges and Caſualities belonging to the Admiralitie of <hi>Orknay</hi> and <hi>Zetland;</hi> it is repreſented, that the Priviledges and Caſualities of the Admiralitie are not ſpecified nor defyned in any Charter or Record, for any thing that does appear: the Charter foreſaid granted to <hi>Lodovick</hi> Duke of <hi>Lennox in Anno.</hi> 1603, bearing only (as ſaid is) <hi>Cum Privilegijs &amp; commoditatibus eiſdem Spectantibus:</hi> And the Charter granted to <hi>Adam Hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn</hi> Earl of <hi>Bothwell</hi> in the Year 1511 (which is the moſt ancient Record of Admiralitie that we have ſeen) bearing only the ſaid Office of Admiral <hi>Totius Regni,</hi> to be given to the ſaid <hi>Adam, Cum omnibus Libertatibus profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuis &amp; eſchetis ejuſdem;</hi> without mention of the Iſles of <hi>Orknay</hi> or <hi>Zetland,</hi> or ſpecifieing the Liberties and Caſualities belonging to the Admirality.</p>
                        <p>It Appears by an Act of Parliament Intituled <hi>concerning certain abuſes of the Admirals proceedings,</hi> being 156. Act of King <hi>James</hi> 6th. his 12. Parliament; that upon pretence of an Infeftment granted to <hi>Francis</hi> Earl of <hi>Bothwell</hi> of the Admiralitie of <hi>Scotland,</hi> containing greater Specialities and diverſe Clauſes which were not in the former Infeftments of Admirality, The People being oppreſſed did Complain, and by the ſaid Act it is Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, that the Admiral and his Succeſſors ſhould exerce no Juriſdiction nor exact no Dutie nor Caſualitie, But that which was in uſe to be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and taken by the Admiral for the tyme, before the Death of King <hi>James</hi> 5th: And therefore it is humblie conceived, that whoſoever ſhall be found to have Right to the Admiralitie of <hi>Orknay</hi> and <hi>Zetland,</hi> It is fit that the Priviledges and Caſualites of the ſame, be ſo defyned and cleared, that the Fiſhing, Trade, and Trafficque be not interrupted nor diſturbed; And that his Maieſty be not prejudged of his Rents of <hi>Orknay.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is humblie repreſented to his Majeſties Conſideration, The Records being for the moſt part loſt, which might have cleared his Majeſties Intereſt; and the Right of Admiralitie being Granted to the Dukes of <hi>Lennox</hi> in manner foreſaid; and neither the Dukes Right nor the Right of Admiralitie granted to the preceeding Admirals being ſpecial as to the Iſles of <hi>Orknay</hi> and <hi>Zetland;</hi> and the ſaid Iſles of <hi>Orknay</hi> being the Kings Propertie, and feued only to the Earles of <hi>Orknay,</hi> and now Annexed to the Crown; and the ſaid Iſles being ſo remote and of ſo vaſt an extent, and formerlie poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed by the King of <hi>Denmark;</hi> and upon Tranſactions with the ſaid King which are not very ancient, being reunited to this Kingdom; Whether or not the Right of Admiralitie granted to the Dukes of <hi>Lennox</hi> ought to be extended to the ſaid Iſles of <hi>Orknay</hi> and <hi>Zetland?</hi>

                     <p>IN the caſe <hi>Broun</hi> contra <hi>Veatch</hi> and <hi>Scot, It was found,</hi> after contentious debate <hi>in Praeſentia,</hi> At the Barr, and betwixt the Lords; That an
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94635:127"/>
Infeftment of Warrandice baſe, to be holden of the granter, ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable to a publick Infeftment of property granted thereafter holden of the Superior, and cled wih poſſeſſion diverſe years: And that the poſſeſſion of the Principal Lands ſhould be interpreted the poſſeſſion of the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randice Lands. Some of the Lords were of another Iudgment upon theſe grounds. 1. By the Act of <hi>Parliament Ja.</hi> 5. <hi>par.</hi> 7. <hi>cap</hi> 150. (Entituled proviſion and pains of them committand fraud in alienation and otherwiſe) a publick Infeftment is preferable to a baſe not cled with poſſeſſion though anterior: And both the <hi>verba</hi> and <hi>Ratio Legis,</hi> do militate in favours of the Heretor by a publick Infeftment; The intention and end of the Law being to obviat fraud and prejudice by latent Infeftments: And it being all one, as to the intereſt and prejudice of the party who acquireth Lands, whether the privat and latent Infeftment be a Right of property or War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randice, Seing an Infeftment of Warrandice, when the principal Lands are evicted, becometh an Infeftment of Property.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Act of <hi>Parliament</hi> foreſaid of <hi>K. Ja.</hi> 5th. is not taken away by the Act of <hi>Parliament K. James</hi> 6. <hi>Par.</hi> 17. <hi>anent Regiſtration of Seaſins;</hi> in reſpect, an Infeftment of property being baſe, though Regiſtrate and Anterior, will be null in prejudice of a party, who has acquired a Right by a poſterior publick Infeftment: And both the ſaids Acts of Parliament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>remedia quae tendunt ad eundem finem,</hi> though the hazard be not ſo great as to the prejudice by latent and private Infeftments, ſince the Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament anent Regiſtration of Seaſins: The ſaid Act of <hi>Parliament</hi> 1617. doth not derogate to the Act of <hi>Parliament, K. Ja.</hi> 5.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. As to that pretence, That the poſſeſſion of the principal Lands is the poſſeſſion of the Warrandice <hi>fictione Juris, It was Anſwered,</hi> That there is no ſuch <hi>fictio</hi> warranted by any Law: and ſo it is <hi>Fictio,</hi> but not <hi>Juris.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2do. It is a <hi>Fictio contra Jus, &amp; cui Jus reſiſtit;</hi> in reſpect the Heretor by the publick Infeftment of property being in poſſeſſion, no other perſon can be ſaid to be in poſſeſſion, ſeing there cannot be two <hi>Domini in ſolidum,</hi> nor two <hi>Poſſeſſores</hi> by diſtinct Rights, having no ſubordination or dependance one upon another, as Liferenter and Fiar, Superior and Vaſſal, Maſter and Tennent; or ſuch like.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It is clear, that the poſſeſſion of the principal Lands cannot be thought the poſſeſſion of the Warrandice; Seing if after Fourty Years the principal Lands ſhould be evicted; and a purſuit for Warrandice and recourſe ſhould be in ented upon the Right of Warrandice, though Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription cannot be obtruded, yet if there be any defect in the Infeftment of Warrandice, as <hi>v. g.</hi> The Diſpoſition is ſubſcribed by one Notar, or ſuch like; The ſame may be alledged: Whereas, if that Infeftment were cled with Fourty Years Poſſeſſion, the Right would be preſcribed, and could not be queſtioned upon any Ground whatſoever, but Falſehood.</p>
                     <p>In this Proceſs, It was <hi>Questioned</hi> whether the Heretor, who had the publick Infeftment, having been in Poſſeſſion above Seven Years, ſhould have the benefite of a poſſeſſory Judgement, until a Declarator and a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet <hi>in petitorio.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some of the <hi>Lords</hi> thought, that in the caſe of Warrandice, the Heretor ſhould not have the benefite of a Poſſeſſory Judgement againſt the Purſuer upon an Infeftment of Warrandice; <hi>quia non valebat agere:</hi> But the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion was not decided.</p>

                     <p>THE <hi>Lords,</hi> upon debate and deliberation, <hi>Found,</hi> That a Perſon addebted in payment of a Sum upon a Wadſet, may pay his Debt, and take a Renunciation, tho the Creditor granter be inhibited; and that Inhibitions do not affect Renunciations.</p>
                     <p>The Reaſons that moved theſe that were for the Deciſion, are. 1. That Inhibitions do hinder the Liedges to purchaſs from Perſons inhibited, but not to borrow Money from them; and as they may lawfully pay the Sums they borrow, ſo they may take Diſcharges and Renunciations. 2. When a Perſon does grant a Renunciation of a Wadſet, he doth not grant a Voluntar Right, but only a Diſcharge upon the matter, which in Law he might be forced to give, upon an Order of Redemption. 3. A Perſon inhibite might take Payment and grant Diſcharge of an heretable Bond, even before Sums due upon ſuch Bonds became arreſtable. 4. If In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions ſhould affect Renunciations of Wadſets, then they could not be granted without conſent of the Creditor who had inhibited, even after an order of Redemption. 5. The Inhibition, where it mentioneth and prohibiteth Renunciations, is to be underſtood of Voluntar Renuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which the Party inhibite is not obliged to grant; As <hi>v. g.</hi> An He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retor having a Baſe Right irredeemable, ſhould after Inhibition renounce the ſame. 6. If a Wadſet had been granted before the Inhibition, the Creditor may renounce, becauſe in Law, and by the Contract he is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged upon payment to renounce, ſo that it is not a voluntar Deed; And there is <hi>eadem Ratio</hi> in Wadſets after Inhibition; ſeing the Right is gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with that condition that upon payment the Creditor ſhould renounce; And as I may grant a Right to a Perſon inhibited, ſo I may grant it with that Quality, that he ſhould be obliged to re-diſpone, in which caſe he may lawfully diſpone back again, notwithſtanding of the Inhibition.</p>

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:94635:150"/>
was Replyed,</hi> That the Wadſet was prior to the Defenders Right; yet this Right being qualified (as ſaid is) the Father might have contracted Debts, and granted obligements after the ſaid Right; and the Defender would be lyable to the ſame; ſeeing the Lands and the Fathers intereſt in the ſame being upon the matter a Fee and power to redeem and diſpone, might have been compryſed for his Debt contracted after the ſaid Right.</p>

                        <hi>The Lords</hi> repelled the alledgance, and <hi>Found,</hi> the Defender would be lyable as Suceſſor, the purſuer proving that the Wadſet was Anterior: As to the ſecond queſtion, the Lords thought it not neceſſar to decide, being of very great conſequence, and deſerving hearing <hi>In praeſentia,</hi> ſeing it was notour that the Wadſet was before the Defenders Right: Yet we inclined for the moſt part to think, that when ſuch Rights are granted or Purchaſed by Parents to their appearand Heirs, they ſhould be lyable to all the Debts due and contracted thereafter; at leaſt <hi>ſecundum vires &amp; in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Lucrantur:</hi> And beſide the abovementioned reaſons, theſe may be urged 1. the Father having by ſuch a reſervation, not only a reverſion but in effect a Right of propertie, In ſo far as he has power to Diſpone and wadſet as if he were Fiar; if he ſhould diſcharge the ſaid Reſervation his Diſcharge would inferr againſt his Son the paſſive title of Succeſſor <hi>titulo lucrativo;</hi> having gotten thereby an abſolute and irredeemable Right which he had not before; And therfore he not uſeing the power com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent to him by the ſaid Reſervation, being equivalent as if he had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged the ſame, ought to operate the ſame effect. 2. Such a Right is in effect <hi>Praeceptio Haereditatis cum of effectu</hi> only the time of the Fathers deceaſe, ſeeing before that time it is in his power to Evacuat the ſame; and therefore the time of the Fathers deceaſe is to be conſidercd ſo as the Son cannot be ſaid to have Right or to Succeed effectualy before that time, and ſo ought likewiſe to be lyable to the Debts contracted at any time before his Fathers deceaſe.</p>

                     <p>IN the late War betwixt his <hi>Majeſtie</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> a <hi>Swed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> Ship being taken by a <hi>Scots</hi> Caper and adjudged Pryze: A Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the Admirals Decreet was purſued, upon diverſe reaſons; and in ſpecial this, That by the Treatie betwixt his <hi>Majeſtie</hi> and the Crown of <hi>Swed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,</hi> the Subjects of <hi>Sweden</hi> may traffique with their Alleys, though Enemies to h s <hi>Majeſtie</hi> with freedom; and carry in their Ships Counterband Goods, Except ſuch as are contained in an Article of the ſaid Treaty, being for the moſt part Armes, and <hi>Inſtrument a Bellica;</hi> and that the Goods in queſtion which they had carried in their Ships to <hi>Holland, viz.</hi> Tarr and ſtock fiſh were not of that nature. 2. That when the ſaid Ship was taken, there was none of the ſaids Goods aboard; and that it could not be declared Pryze upon pretence That immediatly before they had carried the ſaid Goods to <hi>Holland;</hi> ſeing it is not unlawful not a breach of Treatie betwixt his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> that the Subjects of <hi>Sweden</hi> ſhould continue the ſame inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and freedom of Trade they had formerly with their friends, though now the Kings Enemies: and if they carrie counterband Goods, the only hazard is that if they be deprehended carrying the ſame, They may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcat; conform to the Treatie with <hi>Sweden,</hi> bearing <hi>ſi Deprehendantur;</hi> which is Conſonant to the cuſtom of all Nations, and of the Admirality of <hi>England. It was Alledged,</hi> that the Ship in Queſtion ſhould not have the benefit of the Treatie, having Served the <hi>Danes</hi> the Kings Enemies, and being fraugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and loaded with Tarr from <hi>Noraway</hi> upon the account of <hi>Daniſh</hi> Merchants, and with ſtock Fiſh which they had carried to <hi>Amſterdam:</hi> That it was expreſly provided by the Treatie with <hi>Sweden,</hi> that they ſhould not carry <hi>bona hoſtium;</hi> and that tho the <hi>Danes</hi> were not the Kings Enemies, yet Tarr and Stock-fiſh are Counterband, Tarr being a Material ſo uſeful and neceſſary for a Naval Warr; and that by the Treatie, <hi>Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atus</hi> is counterband and Stock-fiſh falleth under the notion of <hi>Commeatus:</hi> and that by the Commiſſion given by the Admiral to the Capers, they are empowered expreſly to ſeize on Ships, not only while they have counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band Goods caryeing to his <hi>Majeſties</hi> Enemies, but upon the return having ſold and diſponed upon the ſame. <hi>It was Replyed,</hi> 1. That by the Law of Nations (which is clear from <hi>Grotius de Jure Belli</hi>) Goods that are <hi>uſus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcui</hi> both in Warr and Peace are not <hi>vetita</hi> and counterband; and two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions being engaged in Warr with others that are at friendſhip with both are allowed libertie of Trade with either as to ſuch Goods: And that Tarr is of that ſame nature, and <hi>Commeatus,</hi> except in the caſe of <hi>portus clauſus,</hi> or <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitas obſeſſa,</hi> and from which <hi>deditio</hi> may be expected if not ſupplied. 2. His <hi>Majeſties</hi> Declaration of Warr with <hi>Holland,</hi> bears, that Ships carrying coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terband to <hi>Holland,</hi> if they be mett with carrying the ſame, may be ſeized; and that his <hi>Majeſties</hi> Declaration, Emitted of purpoſe in relation to other Nations, ſhould be conſidered as <hi>lex Belli,</hi> and not a privat and unwarant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſtyle of a commiſſion given <hi>periculo petentis.</hi>

                     <p>In this, many Points being debated, It was <hi>Found</hi> by the <hi>Lords,</hi> that Tarr is Counterband. 2. As to that Point, whether a Ship having carried counterband Goods to Enemies, may be ſeized upon in her return home-ward, having ſold and vented the ſame to the Enemies and not deprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded carrying the ſame; They thought fit to know his <hi>Majeſties</hi> pleaſure,

                     <p>THE Kings Majeſty, having by two Letters to the Lords of Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, preſented Mr. <hi>David Balfour</hi> of <hi>Forret,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Thomas Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray</hi> both Advocates, to be Lords of the <hi>Seſſion:</hi> It was moved by one of the Lords, that ſeing by the Law and Acts of Parliament, theſe who are to be admitted to be Lords of Seſſion, ſhould be tryed; Therefore the Tryal ſhould be ſuch as is intended by the Law; the very Notion of Tryal importing, at leaſt a ſerious, if not a ſtrict and exact way of Tryal.</p>
                     <p>This was moved, becauſe the way of Tryal had become of late ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>functorious, and <hi>dicis cauſa,</hi> that it was ridiculous, and in effect a Mock-Tryal: Some of the Lords being appointed to examine theſe who were named by the King, and after they had asked ſome trivial Queſtions, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:94635:159"/>
made Report, That they found them qualified; albeit it was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known to the Examinators, but to all the Lords, and notour to the World, that they were altogether Ignorant both of Law and Practique; and did acknowledge it themſelves, not dareing to expoſe themſelves to ſit in the Outer houſe as Ordinaries; they prevailing with others of the Lords to go out and officiate for them as Curats.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It was urged, that the Eſtates had conſidered the Intereſt of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; all Eſtates being concerned in that Judicatory, that the Lords ſhould be Perſons of great Abilitie and Integrity, ſeing their Lands and Fortunes and greateſt Intereſts, are the Subject of their Juriſdiction and Deciſions: and therefore it was provided by diverſe Statutes and Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they ſhould be qualified Perſons, and found upon Tryal to be ſuch.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. His Majeſties Letter required, that the Perſons now named, ſhould be examined effectually.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. By diverſe Acts of Sederunt, and in ſpecial one upon the Kings Letter, for the time, the way of Tryal is preſcribed, which is moſt exact.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Oath of Admiſſion, that the Lords ſhould be faithful, has and ought to have Influence upon all their Actions, as Lords of the Seſſion, that they ſhould be done faithfully; and the Tryal of Lords for the Reaſons foreſaid, being an important Act of Duty, ought to be done faithfully and ſincerely, and cannot be done otherways without breach of Oath.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. To pretend to obey the Law, and the Kings Letter (which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth an effectual Tryal) in a way which is ſuperficiary, and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ineffectual; it is a Cheat, and <hi>Circumventio Legis;</hi> which in others is hateful; but in Judges, who are <hi>Antiſtites Juris,</hi> is abominable, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the Honour and Integrity that ſhould be expected from the Judicatory.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. If there were no Tryal at all, the Lords would be paſſive, if Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons not qualified ſhould be named; but being enjoyned to try effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if they receive them without an effectual tryal, they are not free of blame; and are accomptable to God, and his Majeſty, and to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
                     <p>To all theſe Reaſons, <hi>It was Anſwered,</hi> That at this time the way of Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al that had been for a long time, ſhould be continued at this time; and that the Motion was upon ſome deſign.</p>
                     <p>The Mover did purge himſelf upon Oath, that he had no Deſign, but to do duty; and did atteſt the Preſident, that before this occaſion they had ſpoken often to that purpoſe: and did repreſent, that this is the fit time to put the Law and Statutes in execution; The Perſons named being Advocats, and Perſons preſumed to be able to undergo the Tryal; ſo that it cannot be thought that there is any thing of Deſign againſt their Perſons: That it cannot be denyed, but the late way is abuſive; and <hi>antiquitas erroris,</hi> or <hi>abuſus,</hi> cannot be thought and pleaded to be cuſtom: That in the Year 1629. the Lords by an Act of <hi>Sederunt,</hi> had renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ratified all the former Statutes anent the Tryal and Admiſſion of the Lords; and ordained them to be obſerved; That ſince that time the Troubles interveened and continued long, ſo that Preſcription cannot be
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:94635:159"/>
pretended for an abuſe which had occaſioned ſo great prejudice and clamour.</p>
                     <p>It was Carryed, That the Examination ſhould be as it has been of late: and upon the Report of <hi>Gosford</hi> and <hi>Craigie,</hi> (appointed to examine them) they were admitted: <hi>Gosford</hi> was of Opinion that there ſhould be another way of Tryal.</p>

                     <p>The ſaids Lords, Who were of the ſaid opinion, thought, That upon the Grounds and Production foreſaid, the Feuars of <hi>Drakies</hi> ought to be lyable without any farther probation, to Stents impoſed for the uſe and intereſt of the Town; the ſame being impoſed neceſſarly and equally according to the method abovementioned: And yet the Town having adduced proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by production of the Records out of their Books and Witneſſes; they conſidered and thought, that the poſſeſſion of the Town, by impoſing their Stents by the ſpace of 40. years, was proven: In reſpect, it appeared by the Extracts out of their Books, That from the year 1624. until 1664. they have been in uſe to impoſe Stents in caſe of Exigency, for the private uſe and concerns of the Town; Notwithſtanding of what was alledged at the Bar, againſt the ſaid probation, and in ſpecial, that the Books them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ought to be produced; whereas there was nothing produced but Extracts of Acts, and that the probation, that the Town has been in uſe to Stent for repairing their Bridge, did not quadrate to the caſe and point in queſtion; ſeing it was to be proven that Stents were impoſed for the private uſe and concerns of the Town, and the Bridge and repairing of the ſame is of publick concern and intereſt, relating not only to the good of the Town, but of the whole Shire: And the Record, anent Stent in relation to the Bridge being out of the way, and not conſidered as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation; It was not proven, that the Town had been in Poſſeſſion 40.

                     <p>Nevertheleſs, The plurality of <hi>the Lords</hi> did <hi>Find</hi> the Alledgeance foreſaid of Poſſeſſion, by the time foreſaid, not proven; upon that ground that the Bridge was not to be conſidered as the proper concern of the Town: And did ſuſpend and declare in favours of <hi>Inches</hi> and other Feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars: Diverſe of the ſaids Lords diſſenting upon the Grounds foreſaid; and that it appears to them, that the Feuars, upon the account of their Lands, were Lyable to be Stented, being the ancient and proper Burgal Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony of the Town: And albeit a continued tract of Poſſeſſion by the ſpace of 40. years, which hardly is to be expected <hi>in ſervitutibus,</hi> or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions that are diſcontinue, could not be made out, as they conceive it was; yet the Feuars having homologate and conſented, and ſubmitted to the ſaid Impoſitions without repineing, until after the Year 1664.

                     <p>
                        <hi>It was Anſwered,</hi> That the ſaid Alledgance was not now competent; ſeing the Debate, whereupon the Interloquitor proceeded, was concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Suſpenders Feues, which they hold of the Town, which compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend both Lands, Milns, and Fiſhings: and there is no reaſon of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, why the Milns and Fiſhings ſhould be in an other caſe than the Lands.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It was Anſwered</hi> for the Town, That in all the Debate, there had been no mention of Milns and Fiſhings; and they were content to make Faith, that they did not underſtand the Debate to be concerning the Milns and

Fiſhings, but only the Lands of <hi>Drakies;</hi> And if they had thought that they had been concerned to prove their Poſſeſſion as to the Milns and Fiſhings there was that ſpeciality that they might have proven more clearly their Poſſeſſion, as to the Milns and Fiſhings, than as to the Lands: and now they are able to prove the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Some of the Lords thought, That the Queſtion being of that Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to an Incorporation, and they wanting the Aſſiſtance of their moſt able Advocats, upon the occaſion abovementioned; and the exception being undoubtedly relevant to inferr their Right, and the concluſion of their Declarator, as to the Milns and Fiſhings, that they ſhould be lyable to be ſtented if it were proven; It were hard, that their Right ſhould be taken from them upon a quirck, and pretence of Omiſſion, being upon a miſtake, as ſaid is. In end, the Plurality of the Lords <hi>did Declare,</hi> by their Interloquitor, That if in <hi>November</hi> the Town ſhould be able to make appear by ancient Records, that they had been in Poſſeſſion of ſtenting the Milns and Fiſhings, with the Tenements of the Town, when Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions and Stents were laid on by the Town only (and not by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament) for their private uſe, that the ſame ſhould be lyable as other Burgal Lands.</p>

And thereafter being charged, the ſaid Earl ſuſpended upon that reaſon, that the ſaid Bonds were granted by him to <hi>Melgum</hi> for the price of Lands Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned by him to the Earl; and by a Back-bond of the date of the ſaid Bands, <hi>Melgum</hi> was obliged to Warrand the Rental of the ſaid Lands for two years: and <hi>quatenus</hi> the Tennents ſhould be ſhort in payment of their duties, the time forſaid, he ſhould pay wherin they ſhould be wanting, and that the Earl might retain in the firſt end of the foreſaid Sums: And that the ſaid Earl had got a Decreet againſt the Tennents of the ſaid Lands, for payment of the Sums therein contained; and therefor that he had ground of retention and compenſation upon the foreſaid Bond granted by <hi>Melgum</hi> effeirand to the Sums reſtand by the ſaid Tennents.

                        <hi>ratione operae,</hi> and as Sentence-Silver; ſo that they cannot be due, but to the preſent Incumbent, who does a duty; and that Compoſitions for entering of Vaſals and Liferent Eſcheats and Non-entrys, and ſuch like caſualities do not fall under <hi>Ann.</hi> Whereunto <hi>It was Anſwered,</hi> That by the Kings Letter, by the Act of Parliament, and by the Canon Law, the half of the Rent of the Benefice, Stipend, and Living fall under the <hi>Ann;</hi> and the <hi>Quots</hi> of Teſtaments are a conſiderable part of the Biſhops Rent, eſpecially in <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> and undoubtedly is a part of his Living and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: And the Rent of Milns which is caſual, and depends, where there is no aſtriction, upon the arbitrary will of Parties to come, or not to come to the ſame, and is likewayes due <hi>ratione operae;</hi> doth fall under <hi>Ann:</hi> As alſo the Rent of Fiſhings, and ſuch like which are caſual: And there is a great difference betwixt <hi>Quots,</hi> which is an ordinary yearly Rent, and cannot fail ſo, but there will be ſtill Teſtaments confirmed; and the caſualities of Superiority as Liferents <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are ſo uncertain; as that it cannot be ſaid, they are the Biſhops Living: And the Argument, that <hi>Quots</hi> are due <hi>ratione operae,</hi> and by reaſon of actual confirmation, which cannot be due by the Executors or Relict, is of no weight; ſeing the other conſtant Rent of Stipends and Benefices is due <hi>ratione operae,</hi> and becauſe the Biſhop or Miniſter ſerveth, which is not preſtable by Executors or Relicts.</p>

                        <hi>The Lords,</hi> upon a Report, having debated amongſt themſelves, what was fit to be done in the ſaid Caſe, ſeing it appeared that the ſaid Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite was intented, not of deſign to queſtion the Bond, upon evident and probable Grounds of Falſehood, but only to have it produced; and it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared by many Preſumptions, that the Bond was a true Deed, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver queſtioned by the granter <hi>ex capite falſi,</hi> tho he had ſuſpended upon

other Reaſons; And there had been much diligence by Decreets, Horn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Compryſing upon the ſame; and yet the Bond being of an anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Date, beyond 40 years, there was no perſon living that could prove the Tenor thereof, and declare that they knew the ſame to be a true Deed: And on the other part, the Lords could not refuſe to grant Certification, ſeing an Extract does not ſatisfy in an Improbation, where the Principal was not produced.</p>
                     <p>It was moved by ſome of the Lords, That if the Purſuite was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented within the years of Preſcription, that it ſhould not be ſuſtained; ſeing albeit <hi>cauſa falſi</hi> doth not preſcrive, where the Paper or Subject craved to be improven is produced; and the Purſuer offers to improve and make it appear that the ſame is falſe; yet when the Improbation is only to try the condition of the Defenders Right, and in order to a Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, if the Principal cannot be exhibit, it is not properly <hi>cauſa falſi:</hi> And the effect of the Certification is only that the Write for not production ſhould be holden as falſe <hi>praeſumptive,</hi> and <hi>fictione Juris:</hi> And upon the matter it is but a Reduction for not Production.</p>

                     <p>A Teſtator having left by Teſtament a Sum of Money, due upon an Heretable Surety; and having named his Siſter as Executor and univerſal Legator, ſhe was purſued for payment of the ſaid Legacy; at the leaſt, that being likeways Heir, ſhe ſhould denude her ſelf of the Right of the ſaid Sum.</p>

                     <p>THE deceaſt Lord <hi>Sinclair,</hi> having maryed his Daughter with <hi>John Sinclair</hi> younger of <hi>Hermiſton,</hi> did diſpone to him his Eſtate, with the Burden of his own proper Debts, mentioned in the Right; and took a Bond for an Annuity of 8000 <hi>merks,</hi> firſt in the name of <hi>John Watt,</hi> and thereafter the ſaid Bond being given back, he did take another Bond, for the ſaid Annuity during his Lifetime, in the Name of <hi>George Cockburn</hi> of <hi>Pilton:</hi> Whereupon the ſaid <hi>George</hi> did diligence by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pryſing and otherways, againſt the ſaid <hi>John Sinclair</hi> of <hi>Herdmanſton;</hi> and did alſo take the ſaid <hi>John Sinclair</hi>'s Liferent Eſcheat. And upon the Grounds foreſaid, and a Suſpenſion of double Poinding againſt him, diverſe Creditors of the Lord <hi>Sinclair</hi> did queſtion <hi>Pilton</hi>'s Intereſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the foreſaid Bond, as being fraudulent, and a contrivance to fruſtrate Creditors, and to ſecure ſo conſiderable an Intereſt for the uſe of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitor, contrare to the Act of Parliament, 1621.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Lords,</hi> notwithſtanding, preferred the ſaid <hi>George Cockburn,</hi> as having Right to the Duties of <hi>Herdmanſton</hi>'s Eſtate, by vertue of the ſaid Gift of Eſcheat; reſerving to the Creditors their Declarator of Truſt, or Reduction upon the ſaid Act of Parliament: And accordingly the whole Eſtate of <hi>Herdmanſton</hi> being ſet in Tack thereafter, the Tack-duty is pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to <hi>Pilton,</hi> and the other Creditors in order, conform to the ſaid De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet.</p>
                     <p>The Tacks-men being charged at the inſtance of <hi>Pilton,</hi> Did Suſpend upon double poinding, pretending they were troubled by other Creditors of the Lord <hi>Sinclair:</hi> And the ſaid Creditors compearing, did alledge, that they ought to be preferred to <hi>Pilton,</hi> in reſpect his intereſt <hi>ab initio</hi> by the ſaid Bond for the Annuity foreſaid of 8000 <hi>Merks,</hi> was a fraudulent contrivance, in prejudice of the Lord <hi>Sinclair's</hi> Creditors; that the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Annuity might be ſecured to him in the Perſon of <hi>Pilton</hi> his Friend and Relation; and thereupon might live plentifully, his Creditors being defrauded, and ſuffering in the mean time: And that the Gift of Eſcheat of <hi>Herdmanſtons</hi>'s Liferent, being granted <hi>intuitu,</hi> and upon account of the ſaid intereſt; <hi>laborat eodem vitio,</hi> and was in effect to the behoof of the Lord <hi>Sinclair.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It was Anſwered</hi> for <hi>Pilton,</hi> That tho the ſaid Bond was granted to him, without an Onerous Cauſe; yet <hi>intuitu</hi> of the ſame, and thinking that he was thereby ſecured, he had <hi>bona fide</hi> alimented my Lord <hi>Sinclair,</hi> and had payed to himſelf, and had engaged to others for him, to pay diverſe Sums of Money, before any interruption made by the Creditors; So that before any Diligence done by them, his Right became Onerous, and the Gift of Eſcheat of <hi>Herdmanſton</hi>'s Eſtate was taken by him, to ſecure himſelf as to his relief: And that the King and Exchequer did, and might give the ſaid Gift to him upon the conſideration foreſaid; and thereupon, in the former Decreet of multiple poinding, he was preferred to all other Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors:
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:94635:169"/>
And that his Majeſty had alſo gifted the Liferent Eſcheat of the ſaid Lord <hi>Sinclair,</hi> to Mr. <hi>George Gibſon,</hi> upon a Back-bond, that thereby he and the other Creditors thereinmentioned being ſatisfied, the <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus</hi> and benefite of the ſaid Eſcheat ſhould be applyed for the Aliment of the ſaid Lord <hi>Sinclair:</hi> And therefore, tho <hi>Pilton</hi> ſhould not have Right as he had to the ſaid Tack-duty, the foreſaid Annuity and Gift of Eſcheat of <hi>Herdmanſton</hi>'s Liferent would accrue to Mr. <hi>George Gibſon</hi> Donator, to the uſes foreſaid; and fall under his Gift.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It was Anſwered</hi> for the Creditors, That they were content the Lords ſhould modify an Aliment for the Lord <hi>Sinclair:</hi> And that <hi>Pilton</hi>'s inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt ſhould be ſuſtained effeirand thereto; the <hi>Superplus</hi> being applyed, as it ought to be, for their ſatisfaction.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Lords,</hi> for the moſt part enclined to Find, that <hi>George Cockburn</hi>'s Right to the ſaid Annuity was Onerous, In ſua far as he could inſtruct, that he had payed to, or for the uſe of my Lord <hi>Sinclair,</hi> any Sums of Money before the Creditors Diligence.</p>
                     <p>Yet ſome were of the opinion, That the Laird of <hi>Hermanſton</hi> having Married my Lord <hi>Sinclair</hi>'s Daughter, and having given the ſaid Bond for the Annuity, dureing my Lord <hi>Sinclair</hi>'s Lifetime, was a down-right contrivance, contrare to the Act of Parliament 1621. to the end that the Right to the ſaid Annuity, which if it had been taken in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of my Lord <hi>Sinclair</hi> himſelf would have been lyable to his Creditors, might be ſo conveyed in the perſon of another, that it ſhould not be lyable to the ſaid Lord <hi>Sinclair</hi>'s Debts; and being <hi>ab initio</hi> fraudulent, it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſtill: And <hi>Pilton</hi>'s applying any part of the ſame, for the uſe of my Lord <hi>Sinclair,</hi> was ſo far from purgeing the Fraud, that by the Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, it was a clear evidence and probation of the ſame.</p>
                     <p>And yet they thought, That <hi>Pilton</hi> having out of reſpect to his Friend lent his name inconſideratly, he might thereafter for his ſecurity take, and the Exchequer might give <hi>Herdmanſton</hi>'s Liferent Eſcheat, upon the account foreſaid; and the ſame cannot be thought to be to the behoof of my Lord <hi>Sinclair,</hi> unleſs it had been either procured by my Lord <hi>Sinclair,</hi> or granted expreſly for his uſe: And as to my Lord <hi>Sinclair</hi>'s own Liferent, His Majeſty and Exchequer might qualify the Gift as they they thought fit; and His Majeſty might have been concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon many conſiderations, that my Lord <hi>Sinclair</hi> ſhould not want an Aliment; and might either have detained his Liferent in his own hands, in order to his Aliment, or given the ſame <hi>ſub modo,</hi> and with the Burden thereof: And the ſaid Gift was given as to the <hi>Superplus</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, for the Lord <hi>Sinclair</hi>'s Aliment, not to be modifyed by any other, but by the Exchequer, and at their ſight and direction, as the ſaid Gift bears.</p>
                     <p>Upon the Grounds foreſaid <hi>the Lords</hi> did prefer <hi>Pilton</hi> conform to the former Decreet. Sir <hi>David Falconer</hi> and others for the Creditors alteri <hi>Dalrymple.</hi>

                     <p>THE deceaſt Sir <hi>William Dick</hi> having charged the Lord <hi>Balmerinoch</hi> for payment of a great Sum of Money due by a Bond, granted by his Father, and diverſe other Noblemen, who were Actors in the late times; and did borrow the ſaid Sums for the uſe of the publick (as they called it) and the ſaid Lord <hi>Balmerinoch</hi> having Suſpended upon diverſe Reaſons, and alſo upon a Reaſon of Compenſation Founded upon a Bond granted by the ſaid Sir <hi>William</hi> to Sir <hi>John Smith;</hi> whereupon the ſaid Sir <hi>John</hi> had a Right to the Lands of <hi>Northberwick;</hi> and had Aſſigned and Diſponed the ſaid Debt and Right in favours of the Lord <hi>Balmerinoch,</hi> by a Diſpoſition and Aſſignation Blank in the name of the Aſſigney; and no Decreet being Extracted upon the ſaid Proceſs; and the Act of Parliament anent publick Debts, that no Execution ſhould be for the ſame, having interveened;</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>The Creditors of the ſaid Sir <hi>William Dick</hi> pretending Right to the ſaid Lands by diverſe Infeftments, did compear in the ſaid Proceſs, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that the ſaid Right, whereupon the purſuite was Founded, was extinct and ſatisfied, In ſua far as, the ſaid Lord <hi>Balmerinoch</hi> had Found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Reaſon of Compenſation upon the ſame, againſt Sir <hi>William Dick,</hi> which was ſuſtained; and whereupon there was a Minut of a Decreet Suſpending the Letters againſt Sir <hi>William Dick</hi> for the Debt above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned: And that the ſaid Aſſignation granted by Sir <hi>John Smith</hi> had been given up to Sir <hi>William Dick,</hi> or his Son Sir <hi>Andrew,</hi> as their Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; for Exonering the ſaid Sir <hi>William</hi> of the Debt compenſed upon.</p>

that the Suſpender could not be <hi>in tuto</hi> to pay; unleſs the conſent of the Aſſigney were obtained, and that the ſaid Sir <hi>William</hi> was at the Horn and his Eſcheat gifted, and that the Donator did not concur nor conſent. 3.

                        <hi>It was Anſwered</hi> for the Creditors, That in this caſe <hi>res</hi> was not <hi>inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gra,</hi> becauſe the Suſpender had ſo far acquieſced, that in effect he had payed the Debt, Compenſation being equivalent; And if before extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting, he had made actual payment, there would have been no neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of extracting the ſame; and in this caſe not only there was <hi>ſolutio ipſo Jure,</hi> in reſpect of the ſaid Compenſation ſuſtained; but <hi>de facto</hi> the Lord <hi>Balmerinoch</hi> had payed 3 or 4000 <hi>merks</hi> in ſatisfaction of the Debt char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for; the Compenſation being ſo far ſhort: and the Creditors had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented exhibition of a Diſcharge granted by Sir <hi>William Dick</hi> to the ſaid Lord <hi>Balmerinoch,</hi> of the foreſaid Sum of 4000 <hi>merks;</hi> and a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, that in reſpect of the ſaid Compenſation, the ſaid Right granted by the ſaid Sir <hi>John Smith</hi> was extinct.</p>

                     <p>The ſaid Laird of <hi>Kelhead</hi> alleadged, that he ought to be preferred as
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:94635:171"/>
to the Goods confirmed by the ſaid Earl, as Executor to the ſaid Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs, becauſe the ſaid Counteſs was his Debitor in the Sum of 5000 <hi>merks;</hi> and to the effect he might be ſatisfied of the ſaid Debt, had diſponed to him her Moveables if he ſhould not be ſatisfied in her own Lifetime; and that he had done Diligence upon the Diſpoſition of the ſaid Moveables by arreſtment, and by taking Poſſeſſion after the Ladies deceaſe; and thereby had right to the Moveables confirmed by the Earl, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ought to be preferred.</p>

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:94635:172"/>
and not a Prize, by a Decreet abſolvitor of the Admiral; in reſpect it appeared by the Paſs, and other Documents, and the Declaration of the Company and Skipper, that it was a <hi>Sweddiſh</hi> Ship: And albeit the Skip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per was a <hi>Hollander,</hi> yet he was received Burgeſs of <hi>Stockholme,</hi> and ſince the War he had tranſported his Domicile there: This Decreet being queſtioned by a Reduction before the Lords, upon that Reaſon, that the Admiral had committed Iniquity in giving the ſaid Abſolvitor, in regard the ſaid ſhip was not a free ſhip; And it did appear from the Declarations of the Skipper and Company, that the Skipper was a <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander;</hi> and a Partner of an eight part of the ſaid ſhip: And after a long Debate, The Lords granted a Commiſſion to the magiſtrates of <hi>Stockholme</hi> in <hi>Sweden,</hi> to examine ſuch witneſſes as either Party ſhould deſire, for clearing the point of Fact; and to examine the <hi>Sweds</hi> that were alledged to have intereſt in the ſaid Ship and Loadning; and the Skippers wife who was then at <hi>Stockholme:</hi> And diverſe perſons and Witneſſes being examined upon the ſaid Commiſſion, at the Inſtance of the Skipper and Defenders in the Reduction; and a Report being return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and adviſed: The <hi>Lords,</hi> in <hi>July</hi> laſt, did <hi>Find,</hi> That the ſaid Report was a ſufficient preſumptive Probation, that the Skipper had fixed his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micile at <hi>Stockholme,</hi> and that the Ship and Goods were free and did not belong to the Kings Enemies; The <hi>Swedes</hi> by the Treaty betwixt <hi>Sweden</hi> and our King being allowed to make uſe of <hi>Hollanders</hi> to be <hi>Naucleri</hi> and Skippers, <hi>dummodo ſint Cives &amp; Incolae:</hi> and therefore decerned; ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeding the extracting of the Decreet until <hi>September:</hi> and if the Purſuers ſhould ſhew, that they had done Diligence upon the ſaid Commiſſion, the Lords declared they would grant a new Commiſſion.</p>
                     <p>And thereafter an Agent <hi>Matthew Colvil,</hi> having gone to <hi>Stockholme,</hi> in behalf of, and for the Purſuer the Privateer; and having urged, that ſome Witneſſes ſhould be examined by the Magiſtrates there, upon the Points contained in the former Commiſſion; upon that conſideration, that no perſon was preſent for the Privateer, when the Witneſſes were exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at the inſtance of the Defenders; and it was not the Purſuers fault, that he was not there himſelf or his Procurator, ſeing the ſaid Mr. <hi>Colvil</hi> going there, and purſueing the ſaid Commiſſion, had made Ship-wrack by the way, and was forced to return back.</p>
                     <p>The ſaids Magiſtrates did refuſe to proceed upon the ſaid Commiſſion to examine the ſaid Witneſſes, that had been formerly examined, or others pretending that the Commiſſion was execute, and that they had examined both Parties and Witneſſes upon the ſame: and did write a Letter to the Lords, ſhewing the Reaſons whereupon they had refuſed.</p>
                     <p>This Seſſion, the Cauſe being called <hi>in praeſentia;</hi> the Purſuers did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject againſt the ſaid Report, whereupon the foreſaid Interloquitor had proceeded; and in ſpecial, that the Depoſitions of the Witneſſes exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at <hi>Stockholm</hi> were not tranſmitted; and that they were not ſo much as named in the Report: and that the Owners had refuſed to declare up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Interrogator, <hi>viz.</hi> whether their Name was only borrowed for the uſe of the Kings Enemies, to colour and continue their Trade; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that they had given their Oaths already to that purpoſe, upon their obtaining of the Paſs: and it was deſired for the Purſuers that the Lords would proceed, without reſpect to the Report and Interloquitor fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid;
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:94635:172"/>
and adviſe and give their Sentence, whether, upon what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, the Reaſon of Reduction was proven.</p>
                     <p>Upon Debate among the <hi>Lords,</hi> It was urged, that they had given a Decreet already, but the Extracting was ſuperſeeded (as ſaid is) conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, in order to the granting a new Commiſſion: And the moſt that the Purſuer could deſire in reaſon, was, that a New Commiſſion ſhould be granted: And all that was before the Lords being formerly adviſed, and a Decreet given thereupon, and the ſame ſtanding, there was nothing now to be adviſed; but the Decreet ought to be Extracted, or at the moſt a new Commiſſion ſhould be given to the Purſuer.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Lords</hi> notwithſtanding, without reſpect to the ſaid former Decreet, did proceed to adviſe and Vote, whether there was alſe much proven, as to condemn the ſaid Ship.</p>
                     <p>It was urged by ſome of the Lords, That tho <hi>res</hi> were <hi>integra,</hi> and there were no Decreet; there is no Ground to adjudge the ſaid Ship upon the pretences foreſaid, ſeing the Skippers Oath being a Party had been taken upon the ſame; and he had declared upon Oath, that he had changed his domicile, and his Reſidence was at <hi>Stockholme;</hi> and his Oath being taken, they needed no other Probation, ſpecially ſeing his Oath is admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niculate with the Depoſitions of his Wife, and others taken upon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion foreſaid at <hi>Stockholme;</hi> being poſitive, that he had Tranſported his Domicile there; and no other Probation was adduced to the contrary.</p>
                     <p>It was farder urged, That the Skipper being a Burgeſs, and being for the time in <hi>Sueden</hi> with his Wife and his Child; The <hi>Suediſh</hi> Owners were <hi>in bona fide</hi> to think, that he was ſuch a perſon, as by the Treaty they might make uſe of as Skipper: And what ever could be pretended againſt him for his own intereſt, ought not to militate againſt them.</p>
                     <p>It was alſo urged, That His Majeſty had written a Letter in favours of the Strangers, recommending them to the Lords Favour and Juſtice; and it would be thought a ſtrange Return, that the Lords ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn both the ſaid Ship, and the Admirals Decreet abſolvitor, and their own former Decreet.</p>
                     <p>It was nevertheleſs Voted and Found by plurality, that the Ship ought to be adjudged upon the ſaid pretences, that the Kings Enemie had the intereſt foreſaid, both as Skipper and as Owner: diverſe of the Lords diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting.</p>

                        <hi>It was Alledged,</hi> That the Purſuer had no intereſt, becauſe the ſaid Bond was Blank in the name of the ſubſtitute, and the purſuer could not be underſtood to be the Bairn to whom the Sum is to be payable after the deceaſe of his Father and Mother, ſeing he was not born the time of the granting of the Bond: And as to the Inhibition it was not at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Purſuer, but of his Father and Mother.</p>

                     <p>In the Proceſs againſt the Town, There was a Defence proponed, <hi>viz.</hi> That my Lord <hi>Loudoune,</hi> who had Intereſt in the ſaid Mortification, had got payment of the ſaid Sum from the Town of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> which they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to prove by his Oath.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Lords</hi> having Ordained his Oath to be taken before Anſwer; And he being Summonded to that effect, he was holden as confeſt: And having thereafter upon a Bill, Deſired to be Reponed to give his Oath, and being Reponed, he was holden as confeſt the ſecond time: And in reſpect that the ſaid Defence was not proven by his Oath, The <hi>Lords</hi> proceeded and decerned againſt the Town.</p>
                     <p>The Town of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> having intented Proceſs againſt the Earl of <hi>Loudoune,</hi> for refounding the ſaid Sum; upon that <hi>medium,</hi> that the ſame was formerly payed to him; and that he had confeſſed, at leaſt was holden as Confeſt, which is equivalent as to the payment of the ſaid Sum.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It was Alledged,</hi> That his being holden as Confeſt, in the Proceſs foreſaid did operate only that the Defence referred to his Oath was not proven, but could not be a Ground of purſuite againſt himſelf, unleſs it were proven by his Oath, that the ſaid Sum was payed to him; and he deſired to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned to his Oath; <hi>It was Anſwered,</hi> That he being twice holden as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, there was no reaſon to Repone him, and his being holden as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt doth operate in Law alſemuch, as if he had confeſſed the ſaid Sum; Seing through his Contumacy the Purſuers are prejudged: And he cannot pretend, that he was not a Party in that Proceſs, ſeing he was holden as Confeſt, and in the ſame Proceſs craved to be Reponed, and was Repon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as ſaid is: And tho he had not been called <hi>ab initio</hi> in that Proceſs, yet being called <hi>incidenter</hi> for proving of an Alledgance; by the certification foreſaid he became Partie therein: And as when an incident Diligence is raiſed againſt a haver of Writes, for proving of an Alledgance; and the having thereof is referred to the Oath of the Defender in the incident; if he be holden as confeſt, tho the Alledgance be not proven, the Purſuer of the Incident will have Execution againſt him as Haver; and for the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage and Intereſt ſuſtained through his Contumacy; ſo it ought to be in this caſe.</p>

                     <p>MY Lord <hi>Lauderdale</hi> His Majeſties Secretary, having writen to the Preſident, concerning the abovementioned Proceſs betwixt Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Gordon</hi> and the <hi>Suedes,</hi> anent the Ship called the <hi>Wine Grape,</hi> That the <hi>Suediſh</hi> Envoy had made Application to his Majeſty, and had repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, That the Decreet againſt the Strangers, was caryed but by two Votes; and had given in a Liſt to his Majeſty, of thoſe that were for, and againſt the ſaid Decreet, with diverſe Reaſons againſt the ſame. It was thought fit, that a Letter ſhould be drawen to His Majeſty, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Grounds, whereupon the ſaid Decreet proceeded; which being done by thoſe who were appointed by the Lords; ſome of the Lords did object againſt the ſame, That they did mention the Lords indefinitly to have given the ſaid Decreet; Whereas His Majeſty was informed of the contrary, and the Information was true; and therefore it was deſired it ſhould bear, That, upon the Votes of the <hi>major</hi> part, which is uſual in all Caſes, the Decreet was pronounced: Specially, ſeing the ſaid Letter did containe the Grounds of, and did aſſert the Juſtice of the ſaid Decreet: So that theſe, who had voted againſt the ſame, could not belye themſelves, and put under their hand the contrarie of what they had voted. And albeit in all Judicatories, even in Parliament, what is done by the plurality doth overrule and conclude the Diſſenters, ſo as to ſubmitt to the ſame: Yet they are not obliged to maintain or aſſert the Juſtice of a Sentence and Act, that they had been againſt in their Judgment and vote.</p>
                     <p>It was, notwithſtanding, carryed by plurality, That without the amendement foreſaid the Letter ſhould be ſubſcribed by all the Lords; the Preſident having promiſed to write to my Lord <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> what was truly <hi>res geſta,</hi> when the ſaid Decreet was given: And upon that aſſureance, ſome of the Lords declared when they ſubſcribed, that they ſubſcribed not their oun ſenſe, but the ſenſe of the Court: And though they were concluded, as ſaid is, yet they were not convinced.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>It was Anſwered,</hi> That the Act of Parliament in <hi>Anno</hi> 1600, was only in the caſe of Hornings upon Citations or Charges to find Law borrowes, or for compearing before the Council, as appears by the narrative of the ſaid Act which doth interpret and regulate the diſpoſitive Words of the Act.</p>
                     <p>And that the Act of Parliament in <hi>Anno</hi> 1592. doth not militate in the caſe of Hornings upon a Clauſe of Regiſtration, ſeing after that Act until the ſaid Act 1606, ſuch Clauſes that Hornings ſhould be upon 6 dayes, were not thought, and <hi>de facto</hi> are not impoſſible.</p>
                     <p>And as to the practique, <hi>It was Anſwered,</hi> that there was a late practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que in <hi>Anno</hi> 1664, upon a Debate in the Innerhouſe, in the caſe of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorth</hi> contra <hi>Frazer;</hi> Whereby it was <hi>Found,</hi> That the Act of Parliament 1600. is to be underſtood, in the caſe foreſaid, where Hornings are upon Charges of the nature foreſaid, for appearing before the Council, and ſuch like; but not in the caſe in queſtion and others of that nature, where Hornings are upon Bonds, and Clauſes of Regiſtration therein contained, which do bind, and cannot be queſtioned by thoſe who do oblidge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Lords</hi> conſidered, that the narrative of the ſaid Act doth clear the meaning of the diſpoſitive words; and there needed not to be a Law and remedy as to Hornings upon Clauſes of Regiſtration, ſeing Parties could not help themſelves as to Charges to compear before the Council, and others of that nature without a Law: But they were Arbiters, and could make a Law to themſelves, as to Clauſes contained in Contracts or Writes, if they thought them grievous or impoſſible: And that there appeared to be a ſingularitie in the caſe mentioned by <hi>Durie,</hi> ſeing the Charge was given in <hi>Orkney</hi> upon 6 dayes, which could not well be ſatisfied: And therefore the <hi>Lords,</hi> for the reaſons foreſaid, did ſuſtain the Horning.

Some of the Lords were of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opinion, upon that Ground, that <hi>ipſo momento</hi> that the parties intromet, there is a Paſſive Title introduced againſt them; which doth not ariſe upon the intention of the Cauſe, but upon their own Act of behaving; and <hi>Jus</hi> being <hi>ſemel quaeſitum</hi> to Creditors cannot be taken from them, except in the caſe of an Executor confirmed before the intention of the Cauſe; againſt whom the Creditor may have Action: And that there is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt a Donator having declared, and an Executor having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed; In reſpect the Executor is lyable to Creditors but not a Donator; and an Appearand Heir having become lyable by intrometting with Moveable Heirſhip, and behaving as Heir, his Intromiſſion is not purged by a ſupervenient Gift; ſeing his immixing is <hi>Aditio facto;</hi> and there is <hi>eadem ratio</hi> as to Intrometters, who are Executors <hi>a tort</hi> (as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lawyers ſpeak) and wrongouſly: And in effect, by their Intromiſſion <hi>adeunt paſſive,</hi> and are lyable to Creditors. <hi>Strathurd</hi> Reporter.</p>

                     <p>A Joint Petition was preſented by the Advocates that had withdrawen; whereby they did not expreſly deſire, that they ſhould be readmitted, but did hold forth that they were free of, and hated the very thought of Sedition, and that the Lords who did beſt know the Reaſons of their withdrawing would vindicate them to His Majeſty; and that they were willing to ſerve with that freedom which their predeceſſors had formerly, and which they conceived was no more than was neceſſary for theſe of their ſtation, in order to the intereſt of the People, that they acknowledge and were willing to ſubmit to the juſt Power of the Lords, as their predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors had enjoyed the ſame, and deſired that the Petition ſhould be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to His Majeſty as ſatisfactory.

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:94635:178"/>
heavy, <hi>viz.</hi> utter and perpetual incapacity; it might be juſtly ſaid, as it is Reported, a Judge in <hi>England</hi> had ſaid in the caſe of a perſon accuſed of Theft, whom he enclined to favour by reaſon of the meanneſs of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of the thing that was ſtollen, being a Watch of Braſs only, and the matter of the Watch being beneath that value which the Law of <hi>England</hi> requires for puniſhing Theives Capitally; And it being Alledged, that the Faſhion with the Matter did exceed the value foreſaid, It is ſaid, that he Anſwered, That he would take no Mans Life for the Faſhion, and it were hard, for the Faſhion and <hi>modus,</hi> and the way of Addreſs to take from ſo many perſons their Livelyhood, and from the Countrey their Service, that was ſo neceſſary to them. And that the Advocates fault being a Joint-withdrawing, they might conceive that the expiation of the ſame ſhould be by a joint Addreſs; And yet the Petition was not joint as to all the Advocates concerned, many having given in and being to give in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Petitions: And as to the matter it was Repreſented, that though the Petition is general, yet the generals therein contained do imply the particulars that would be ſatisfactory, ſeing the Lords did not pretend to any power, but that which was juſt, and no violation was intended of their Liberties, neither was any innovation introduced or obtruded upon them or their carriage in their ſtation. Upon all which, <hi>It was thought,</hi> that the Petition ſhould be tranſmitted ſimply, to the effect it might import Interruption of the Preſcription and Certification; any Acts of Interruption even <hi>quales quales</hi> being ſufficient: And the more ſhort that the Preſcription be, and the higher the Certification and prejudice of Preſcription, as in this caſe; the Interruption being the more favourable.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Lords</hi> notwithſtanding, <hi>Found,</hi> that the Petition not being ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory, could not be tranſmitted to any effect. And yet did declare, that albeit the Proclamation was conceived in theſe terms, <hi>viz.</hi> That if the Advocates ſhould not give ſatisfaction betwixt and the 28. day; if they ſhould apply upon the 28. day, their Application ſhould be thought to be within the time contained in the Act: And that in ſtile of Law, theſe words, <hi>betwixt and a certain Term,</hi> does not exclude the day of the Term.</p>
                     <p>They declared alſo, That the Petition being diſſatisfactory upon that account amongſt others, <hi>viz.</hi> That they did not offer ſatisfaction, nor deſire to be readmitted, That Petitions being given in ſeverally, and bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they deſired to Re-enter, and were willing to give ſatisfaction conform to the Kings Letter and Proclamation, ſhould be received and tranſmitted as ſatisfactory.</p>

De Tutela &amp; Tutoribus;</hi> And <hi>De Adminiſtratione &amp; periculo Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum;</hi> which ought to militate in this caſe, eſpecially in reſpect the ſaid Defender was not only named Tutor, but was a Legator; a conſiderable Sum being left to him by the ſaid Teſtament, which Law preſumes was left to him in contemplation of the burden of Tutory put upon him; ſo that having accepted the ſaid Legacy, and having confirmed himſelf Executor Legator, he could not decline the Office, not to be Lyable as <hi>Tutor</hi> or <hi>ut Protutor.</hi> And it was farder urged, that as Executor Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, he was lyable to do Diligence: To which <hi>It was Anſwered,</hi> That the former Interloquitor was opponed being juſt, and upon Relevant Grounds of Law, in reſpect the Civil Law is not received by us altogether in the caſe of Tutors; the Office of Tutorie by the Civil Civil Law being <hi>munus publicum &amp; neceſſarium,</hi> which no perſon can decline, unleſs he have and alledge a juſt Ground of Excuſe, within the time limited by that Law; whereas by our Law and Cuſtom, when any perſon or perſons are named Tutors, they are at liberty to accept the ſaid Office or not; ſo that a perſon named Tutor until he accept, neither is, nor is obliged to do the Duty of a Tutor: And albeit by the Civil Law, a Legacy being left to a Tutor, is preſumed to be left <hi>eo intuitu</hi> and upon condition, that he ſhould accept to be Tutor, yet by the Civil Law, if the perſon named Tutor do not actually get the ſaid Legacy, <hi>niſi conſecutus ſit,</hi> which are the words of the ſaid Law, he is not obliged to accept the ſaid Office; and it is not, nor can it be ſaid, that the Defender got the ſaid Legacy before he did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept: And as to that other Ground, that the Defender being Executor Legator was obliged to do Diligence; <hi>It was Anſwered,</hi> That by late Deciſions, an Executor Creditor is only lyable to intromet, in order to his own ſatisfaction; and an Executor <hi>qua</hi> Legator is in the ſame caſe as an Executor Creditor; ſeing a Legacy is a Debt payable out of the Executry; and the Legator has no intereſt to confirm, but to the effect he may be payed of the ſame.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Lords Found,</hi> That a Tutor is lyable only from the time that he did accept: and that the leaving to him, and his accepting of a Legacy did not
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:94635:181"/>
alter the Caſe; unleſs before his accepting of the ſaid Office, he not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had owned, but got the ſaid Legacy: And this Purſuit being only <hi>actio Tutelae,</hi> and for Compt and Reckoning againſt the Defender as Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, they did not determine the ſaid Queſtion, How far an Executor Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gator ſhould be lyable? but reſerved the ſame, until the Defender ſhould be purſued as Executor.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Lords,</hi> in the Debate amongſt themſelves, ſome of them did urge theſe Arguments; That a Tutor being lyable only <hi>ratione Officii,</hi> he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be lyable before he accept the ſaid Office; it being inconſiſtent with Law, that he ſhould be lyable to the Duty of an Office before he have it, which would be <hi>Filius ante Patrem.</hi> 2. In Law, a Tutorie is <hi>quaſi Contractus;</hi> and as in all Contracts, it is required that there ſhould be the mutual Deeds of both Parties contracters; and the Nomination (which is the Deed of the Defunct) did not bind the Tutor, until he bind himſelf by accepting, which is his own Deed. 3. That a Tutor, having a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy, ſhould be obliged to accept it, is only provided by the Civil Law; which is the Municipal Law of the <hi>Romans;</hi> and is not of force with us, until it become our Law, either by a Statute, or Cuſtom authorizing the ſame; and even by the Civil Law, <hi>praeſumitur</hi> only that the Legacie left to the Tutor is upon the account foreſaid, but that Preſumption is only in the caſe, where it cannot be thought, that the Defunct would have left the Legacie upon another account, <hi>viz.</hi> of Relation or any other Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; Whereas, in this caſe, it cannot be thought, that the ſaid Legacy was left to the Defender, upon the account that he was Tutor, in reſpect he being the laſt named of the three Tutors, there were no Legacy left to them; and he was Nephew to the Defunct, who had a great kindneſs for him: and the ſaid Legacy was not left to him ſimply, but in caſe his Wife, whom he thought to be with Child, ſhould not be brought to bed of a Son. 4. The Defender could not accept the ſaid Office of Tutor Teſtamentar, Becauſe he and the other two Tutors were named conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly, and the other two living, he could not be Tutor alone.

                     <p>The <hi>Lords</hi> did conſider what was fit to be done in all ſuch like Caſes; and in end, the plurality did reſolve, that where the Sums were ſmall, not exceeding 200. <hi>merks,</hi> the Jaylor might enlarge Priſoners for debt, without any other Warrand but the conſent of the Parties, at whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance they were impriſoned; which they did upon that conſideration, that Poor People, if they ſhould be forced to ſuſpend and relax, with a Warrand to put them out, would be ſometime put to more Charges, than the Debt doth amount to. Five of the Lords did diſſent, being of the Opinion, That the Priſon being His Majeſties Priſon, no perſon could be put in upon Letters of Caption, unleſs the ſame were under the Signet; and no perſon put in by Warrand of the ſaid Letters, could be enlarged without Letters to that effect; <hi>nam unumquodque diſſolvitur, eo modo quo contrahitur:</hi> And the Priſoner being put in for his Rebellion, could not

                     </p>
                     <p>In this Proceſs, <hi>William Vetoh</hi> did compear for his Intereſt, and did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that the Sum in queſtion due by Sir <hi>George Maxuel,</hi> did belong to him, having fallen under the Rebellion of the ſaid <hi>James Sanderſon,</hi> and the Gift of his Eſcheat, firſt Gifted to <hi>David Rodger,</hi> fra whom the ſaid <hi>William</hi> had right, and thereafter to the ſaid <hi>William</hi> himſelf: and tho the ſaid Bond, granted by Sir <hi>George Maxuel,</hi> was granted to the ſaid <hi>Ker</hi> and <hi>Broun,</hi> yet it was granted for the ſame Sums, that were due by the ſaid <hi>Stewarts</hi> to the ſaid <hi>Sanderſon,</hi> as appears by the Bond granted by the ſaid Sir <hi>George Maxuel;</hi> ſo that the foreſaid Sum due to <hi>Sanderſon,</hi> and the Bond for the ſame, having (as ſaid is) fallen and belonged to the King, it does ſtill belong to him and his Donator; Notwithſtanding the ſaid new Bond granted by Sir <hi>George Maxuel</hi> in place of the ſame, ſeing <hi>Surrogatum ſapit naturam, &amp;c. It was Anſwered,</hi> That the ſaid <hi>Sanderſon</hi> being Debitor to <hi>Ker</hi> and <hi>Broun;</hi> as he might have payed his Debt after the Rebellion, or the Creditors might have gotten ſatisfaction by poind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Arreſtment before the Rebels Eſcheat, ſo he might have aſſigned the Debt due to him for their ſatisfaction. Whereunto <hi>It was Anſwered,</hi> for the ſaid <hi>William Vetch,</hi> That the Rebel cannot make aſſignation <hi>ſtante rebellione,</hi> the Act of Parliament <hi>in anno</hi> 1592. <hi>K. Jam.</hi> 6. <hi>Parl.</hi> 12. <hi>cap.</hi> 145. Entituled, <hi>Anent the Eſcheats of Rebels,</hi> Bearing expreſly, That no Aſſignation ſhall be valid being made by a Rebel at the Horn, in defraud of the Creditor; if he be at the Horn for the ſame cauſe: And therefore the ſaid Aſſignation made by <hi>Sanderſon</hi> when he was at the Horn, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of <hi>Rodger, Vetch</hi> his Cedent, at whoſe inſtance he was at the Horn for the ſame Debt, is void: and what may be in the Caſe of actual pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or of Poinding, or legal Diligence, needs not be debated in this caſe; ſeing the Rebel did neither make payment, nor was the ſaid Debt due by the <hi>Stewarts,</hi> affected with Legal Diligence, but a voluntar Aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was made by the Rebel, which being Null, for the Reaſon fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, and the Purſuers Right to the Sum in queſtion, being founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame, the Purſuer can have no Right to the foreſaid Sum; and the ſaid <hi>Vetch</hi> having undoubted Right (as ſaid is) ought to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Lords</hi> by their Interloquitor 10 <hi>Decenber</hi> laſt, did find that an Aſſignation made by a Rebel to his Creditor, albeit for a Debt preceeding the Rebellion, and that the Aſſignation was granted before the Gift of the Rebels Eſcheat, cannot prejudge the King or his Donator: But that payment made by the Rebel, or any other in his name, upon his Precept or Aſſignation, being before the Donators Gift, is ſufficient to liberate the Creditor from Repetition.</p>

                        <hi>It was further Alledged</hi> for the Purſuer, that the ſaid Bond granted and due by the <hi>Stuarts</hi> was extinct and innovat; In fua far as the ſaid Sir <hi>George Maxuel</hi> had granted the ſaid other Bond to the ſaid <hi>Ker</hi> and <hi>Broun</hi> for the ſame Sum, which was equivalent to payment.</p>
                     <p>Whereunto <hi>It was Anſwered,</hi> That the ſaid Bond granted by Sir <hi>George Maxuel</hi> was in effect but a Bond of Corroboration, whereby the ſaid Sir <hi>George</hi> became <hi>expromiſſor,</hi> and upon the matter Surety for the ſaid Sum; So that the former Bond was not innovat nor extinct, being neither Diſcharged nor Retired; but being only to be Diſcharged or Aſſigned upon payment made by Sir <hi>George,</hi> which implyes that it could not be innovat nor extinct, ſeing it could not be Aſſigned if it had been extinct.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Lords</hi> before Anſwer to that Point, <hi>viz.</hi> If the ſaid Tranſaction was equivalent to Payment, declared they would take Sir <hi>George Maxuel</hi>'s Oath <hi>ex officio,</hi> at what time the ſaid Bond granted by the <hi>Stuarts</hi> were delivered up to him, and by whom; and if any Diſcharges were granted to him of the ſaid Bond.</p>
                     <p>Sir <hi>George Maxuel</hi> having declared upon Oath, That he had recovered the ſaid Bond from <hi>Ronald Grahame,</hi> and that he had not taken a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the ſaid Bond either from him or from the ſaid <hi>Ker</hi> and <hi>Broun.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Day the Debate was again reſumed at the Barr, and amongſt the <hi>Lords;</hi> and theſe Arguments were urged by His Majeſties Advocat. <hi>viz.</hi> That by the Rebellion <hi>Jus quaeritur Domino Regi,</hi> and that confiſcation <hi>ex delicto</hi> is upon the matter a Legal Aſſignation, and equivalent to an Aſſignation intimate: And if there were two Aſſignations, and the Debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor being out of the Country, the firſt Aſſignation had been intimate at the Mercat Croſs, and Pear and Shoar of <hi>Leith,</hi> and the Debitor having return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the ſecond Aſſigney had intimate his by way of Inſtrument, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Debitor had <hi>bona fide</hi> made payment to him, the firſt Aſſigney notwithſtanding would be preferable: And tho the Debitor would be free in reſpect of Payment <hi>bona fide,</hi> yet the firſt Aſſigney might repeat the Debt from the ſecond as <hi>indebite</hi> payed to him who had no Right; ſo that the King and his Donator having Right to <hi>Stuarts</hi> Debt, tho the Sum in queſtion had been payed to <hi>Ker</hi> and <hi>Broun</hi> (as it is not) <hi>a paritate rationis</hi> the Donator might repeat the ſame as <hi>indebite</hi> payed to them; ſeing by the ſaid Interloquitor, It is <hi>Found,</hi> That an Aſſignation made by a Rebel, albeit before the Gift, cannot prejudge the King or his Donator, for the reaſon foreſaid; It follows neceſſarly, that the Aſſigney by vertue of ſuch an Aſſignation has no Right to the Sum Aſſigned, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if the Debitor pay the ſaid Sum <hi>bona fide,</hi> tho he may be liberate, yet the ſaid payment cannot prejudge the King, or his Donator, but they may repeat the Sum belonging to them: And if it be not payed, but a Bond is renewed for the ſame, as in this caſe, the Donator ought to be preferred.</p>
                     <p>The Aſſignation being null, as ſaid is, There can be no Innovation or Deed done by the Aſſigney who has no Right, in prejudice of the King or his Donator; ſeing a Debt cannot be innovat but by a perſon having Right to the ſame.</p>
                     <p>The Law does ſo far favour Legal Diligence done by the Creditors of Rebels, that there are ſome Deciſions in their favours preferring their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:94635:185"/>
done before the Gift be declared; but voluntar Deeds done by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels in prejudice of His Majeſty, who has <hi>Jus quaeſitum,</hi> and of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor who has denounced, are altogether reprobate; And the Law being clear, and there being no Deciſion to the contrary in favours of Creditors in the caſe of payment upon ſuch Aſſignations as are void in Law; the Donator ought to be preferred; Otherways a Door ſhould be open to prejudge His Majeſty of His Caſuality, and Creditors of their Diligence, ſeing the Rebel may aſſign, and upon ſuch voluntary Aſſignations pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be made: And there ſhould need no Application to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer for Gifts of Eſcheats, if they may be ſo eaſily evacuate by ſuch practices:</p>
                     <p>It appears by Sir <hi>George Maxuel</hi>'s Oath, and by his Bond, that the ſaid Debt was not extinct; ſeing Sir <hi>George</hi> did act in the Affair as a Truſtee and doer for the <hi>Stuarts;</hi> and their Bonds were neither Diſcharged, nor given back by the Aſſigneys, who had Right to the ſame; but were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by the ſaid Sir <hi>George</hi> by his own means from <hi>Ronald Grahame.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Lords</hi> did adhere to their former Interloquitor, and did <hi>Find</hi> that Creditors getting payment from Rebels, either by poinding or by Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation before Declarator at the Donators inſtance, doth ſecure the Creditor againſt the Donator; And did alſo <hi>Find,</hi> that in this caſe the firſt Bonds were extinct; and that the ſame being delivered to Sir <hi>George Maxuel,</hi> before Declarator at the inſtance of the ſecond Donator, that the Aſſigney is preferable.

                     <p>IN the caſe abovementioned <hi>Veatch</hi> contra <hi>The Creditors</hi> of <hi>James Ker</hi> and <hi>Peter Pallat;</hi> It was farther <hi>Alledged</hi> for the ſaid <hi>William Veatch,</hi> that he ought to be preferred, becauſe by the Act of Parliament 1621. Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignations or other Rights granted by Bankrupts in favours of any of their Creditors, who had not done Diligence, and in prejudice of a Creditor who had done Diligence by Horning or otherwayes, are void: And the Creditor who is partially preferred and gratified, if he recover payment he is Lyable to Refound: And by the Act of Parliament <hi>in Anno.</hi> 1592. anent the Eſcheats of Rebels, <hi>Cap.</hi> 145. Aſſignations made <hi>ſtante Rebellio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne</hi> in prejudice of the Creditor, at whoſe inſtance the Cedent is at the Horn, are Null; and that the ſaid Aſſignation made by <hi>Sanderſon</hi> in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of <hi>Ker</hi> and <hi>Broun,</hi> was made by him after he was at the Horn at the inſtance of <hi>David Rodger, Veatches</hi> Cedent: And the ſaid Aſſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being Null for the Reaſon foreſaid, all that has followed thereupon is void.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It was Anſwered,</hi> That the ſaid Act of Parliament is only to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, in the Caſe when any voluntar Payment or Right is made in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud of the lawful and more timely Diligence of another Creditor, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſerved Inhibition, or uſed a Horning, Arreſtment, Compriſing, or other Lawful Mean to affect the Dyvors Land or Eſtate; and that Horning is not ſuch a Diligence as does affect, being only perſonal Execution againſt the Debitor; and that the ſaid Debt of <hi>Stuarts</hi> was many years contracted by the Rebel after the ſaid Horning; and that the ſaid <hi>Stewarts</hi> reſiding in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and their Bond being conceived after the ſtile of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bonds, did not fall under <hi>Sanderſon</hi> the Creditors Eſcheat.</p>
                     <p>Whereunto <hi>It was Anſwered,</hi> That by the ſaid Act of Parliament, Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts, after they are at the Horn, cannot make any voluntar Right or Payment to gratify or prefer other Creditors; ſo that there is no neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to debate whether Horning doth affect or not; And yet the truth is, Horning is ſuch a Diligence as doth affect, ſeing thereby all the Eſcheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Goods are affected, and do belong to the King, and to the Creditor at whoſe inſtance the Horning is, who is preferable to the King, and has an intereſt in the ſaid Goods; and that what ever belongs to a Rebel, whether the time of the Rebellion, or at any time how long ſoever thereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter during the Rebellion, the ſame accrues to the King, and conſequently to the Creditor in the Horning; and that <hi>nomina debitorum</hi> and Debts <hi>non habent ſitum,</hi> but are perſonal Intereſts, and <hi>ſequuntur perſonam Creditoris;</hi> and if they be moveable, do fall under his Eſcheat, which is a Legal Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation, as ſaid is.</p>

                     <p>Thereafter the ſaid <hi>Margaret</hi> having deceaſed, there being only one Daughter of the ſaid Marriage <hi>Margaret Binning;</hi> the ſaid <hi>Alexander</hi> married a ſecond Wife, and did oblige himſelf to provide the Heirs of that Marriage to 10000 <hi>merks:</hi> And thereafter did induce the ſaid <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet</hi> his Daughter of the firſt Marriage, after her Minority, to give a Bond, obliging her to reſign the abovementioned Tenement to which ſhe was to ſucceed as Heir of Proviſion, to her Father, in favours of her ſelf and the Heirs of her own Body, which failȝiening, in favous of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Binning</hi> her Brother of the ſecond Marriage and his Heirs whatſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; and to do no Deed to prejudge him anent the Succeſſion.</p>
                     <p>The ſaid <hi>Margaret Binning</hi> being thereafter Infeft as Heir of Proviſion to her ſaid Father in the ſaid Tenement, did by Contract of Marriage with <hi>William Brotherſtanes</hi> oblige her ſelf to Reſign the ſaid Tenement in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of her ſelf and the ſaid <hi>William,</hi> and the Heirs of the Marriage; whilks Failȝieing his Heirs whatſomever; and upon the ſaid Reſignation, ſhe and her Husband were Infeft.</p>

did obtain Decreet againſt the Tennents of the ſaid Tenement for Maills and Duties, which being Suſpended by the ſaid <hi>William Brotherſtanes</hi> and turned in a Lybel; <hi>It was Alledged</hi> for him, that he ought to be preferred being Infeft long before the Purſuer, and 7. years in poſſeſſion: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto <hi>It was Replyed,</hi> That the Defender was denuded of any Right that he had by the Infeftment foreſaid in favours of the ſaid <hi>Margaret</hi> and her Heirs of Proviſion foreſaid; and that the Purſuer had thereby Right as Heir of Proviſion to her.</p>
                     <p>To which <hi>It was Duplyed,</hi> That being incarcerat upon the ſaid Decreet againſt him and his Wife (for Implement) he had reſigned for Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as Husband, and Authorizing his Wife; but did not intend, nor could not be decerned to denude himſelf of his own Right, which he had for ſo Onerous a Cauſe by his Contract of Marriage.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Lords,</hi> having conſidered the Procuratory of Reſignation granted by the Defenders Wife and himſelf, did <hi>Find</hi> that he had granted the ſame, not only for Obedience, and for his Intereſt as Husband, but for his own Intereſt, and as taking burden for his Wife; and ſo did denude himſelf of any Right that he had, in favours of his Wife, and the Purſuer as Heir of Proviſion: And therefore preferred the ſaid <hi>Alexander.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Upon the Debate, It was agitate amongſt the Lords, whether ſuch Clauſes in Tailȝies, <hi>viz.</hi> That no deeds ſhould be done in prejudice of the Heirs of Tailȝie and Proviſion and their Succeſſion, do import that the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſuch Obligements ſhould not have power to diſpoſe of the Land that is Tailȝied, and have that liberty which is inherent to <hi>Dominium?</hi> Or if it ſhould import only, that they cannot break the Tailȝie, or provide the Lands in Tailȝie to other Heirs.</p>
                     <p>The Preſident was of Opinion that the Fiar could not diſpone nor do any other Deed: And that the ſaid Clauſe was not reſtricted to the alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or breaking of the Tailȝie. But this point was not decided.</p>

                        <hi>It was Alledged</hi> for the Town of <hi>Aberdeen;</hi> That no Title was produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Purſuer but the Extract of Doctor <hi>Reid</hi>'s Teſtament, bearing the ſaid Mortification; which could not be reſpected, ſeing the ſaid Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract is out of the Books of the Commiſſars of <hi>Aberdeen;</hi> and his Teſtament could not be confirmed, but by the Commiſſars of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> he hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing died out of the Country; and therefore the ſaid Extract could not be conſidered, but as a Copy, and the principal ought to be produced; And it appears, that there was never any Principal, bearing the Maſters of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to have the Election of the Bibliothecare; ſeing the Town of <hi>Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deen</hi> has been in uſe ſince the Mortification to preſent to the ſaid Office; and by a Contract in <hi>anno</hi> 1632. betwixt the ſaid Mr. <hi>Dounie</hi> and the Town, he is preſented to the ſaid Office by the Town; to which Doctor <hi>Dun</hi> the Principal of the Colledge was Witneſs, and the Executors no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate likeways Witneſſes.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Lords Found,</hi> There was no neceſſity to produce the Principal, the Extract being a ſufficient Title: and as to the pretended Nullity, it was not <hi>Juris;</hi> ſeing <hi>non conſtat,</hi> that Doctor <hi>Reid</hi> died out of the Coutry: And if there were any Ground upon the pretence foreſaid, it were only of a Reduction.</p>

                     <p>THE Duke of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> having ſettled upon the Lady <hi>Yeſter</hi> his Daughter, his Eſtate: and thereafter by Contract of Marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the ſaid Lady and my Lord <hi>Yeſter,</hi> containing a Procuratory of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation, whereupon Infeftment followed; the ſaid Eſtate is diſponed and reſigned by her, with conſent of her Father, and him for his Intereſt, in favours of the ſaid Lady, and the Heirs of her Body of that Marriage; and theſe failȝiening, of any other Marriage: With Proviſions contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſaid Procuratory; And in ſpecial, that the ſaid Lands ſhould be redeemable by the Earl, upon a Roſe-noble; and that upon an Order uſed, the ſaid Right in Favors of the Lady and her foreſaids ſhould be void: and two other Proviſions in Caſe of Redemption, <hi>viz.</hi> 1mo. That in Caſe the Duke of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> ſhould think fit to redeem, that the Duke and his Heirs ſhould be lyable, and obliged to pay, (likeas they bind themſelves by the ſaid Proviſion, to pay) to the Lady and her foreſaids, beſides the Tocher, 7000. <hi>lib. ſterl.</hi> at the firſt Term after the Dukes deceaſe. And 2do. That whereas by the ſaid Contract, the Lady, if the Eſtate had not been redeemed, was obliged to pay all her Fathers Debts and Legacies, ſhe ſhould be free of the ſame, in caſe of Redemption: Which Proviſions are contained in the Infeftments.</p>
                     <p>The Duke, having uſed an Order, and having intented thereupon a Declarator of Redemption; concluding that the Lands ſhould be declared lawfully redeemed, and that his Daughter ſhould be decerned to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nude her ſelf; and to grant a Procuratory for Reſigning; ſince ſhe was infeft by publick Infeftment.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It was Alledged,</hi> That as to that Concluſion, that ſhe ſhould renounce; there was no Warrand for the ſame; ſeing there was not a Reverſion in theſe Terms, that ſhe ſhould grant the Lands orderly redeemed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce; in which Terms, Reverſions, which are <hi>pacta de retrovendendo,</hi> are ordinarly conceived; but that the Reverſion, whereupon the Order is uſed, is only a Proviſion contained in the ſaid Contract of the Tenor fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid; with a reſolutive clauſe, in caſe of Redemption, which imports no Obligement upon the Lady, nor <hi>pactum de retrovendendo,</hi> but only <hi>Jus Retractus,</hi> and a Faculty and Power to the Father to Redeem; and in caſe of Redemption, the expiring and Nullity of the Right.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>It was Alledged,</hi> That tho the Lady were to Renounce; her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounciation ought to be qualified and burdened with the proviſions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in her Right; and in ſpecial, with the foreſaid proviſion as to the ſecureing to her 7000. <hi>lib. Sterl.</hi> and the other Proviſion foreſaid for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing her relief of the Debts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It was Replyed,</hi> That as to the ſaid firſt Alledgance; that <hi>ineſt</hi> in all Contracts bearing Reverſions; whether in the formal Terms of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion; or Proviſions upon the matter importing a Reverſion: and <hi>ex ſtylo</hi> all Decreets of Redemption do contain the ſaid Decer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture to Renounce: And the Duke being denuded in favours of his Daughter by publick Infeftment, the <hi>habilis modus</hi> to return again to his Right upon Redemption, is upon the Reſignation.</p>

                        <pb n="135" facs="tcp:94635:192"/>As to the 2d. <hi>It was Anſwered,</hi> That the ſaid Proviſions are not in the Reverſion; and amount only to a perſonal obligement upon the Duke and his Heirs; but not to be a real burden and incumberance upon the Right.</p>
                     <p>As to Debts, <hi>It was Anſwered,</hi> That there needs no other ſecurity for the Lady her relief of the ſame; ſeing ſhe was to be lyable thereto in contemplation of the Right, if it ſhould ſtand effectual in her Perſon: And its provided, in caſe of Redemption, ſhe ſhould be free thereof.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It was Duplyed</hi> as to the ſaid proviſions; That the ſame, being in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Procuratory and Infeftment, are real; and they are inſert <hi>unico contextu</hi> with the proviſion, that the Lands ſhall be redeemable; and doe qualifie the ſame: And that notwithſtanding that it be provided, That in caſe of Redemption ſhe ſhould not be lyable to the Debts, yet ſhe may be in hazard to be overtaken as <hi>Succeſſor Titulo Lucrativo;</hi> In reſpect, by the ſaid Right it is provided, that in caſe of Redemption the ſaid 7000 <hi>lib.</hi> ſhould be given to her and her foreſaids, which being a proviſion intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in her favours, and in effect in lieu of the Eſtate, and being ſo great, may fix upon her a Paſſive Title; as having gotten by her Father beſide her Tocher ſo great a Sum; which is not payable to her Husband, but to her and her foreſaids; and therefore could not Renounce, but with the burden of the ſaid proviſion for her Relief.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Lords Found,</hi> That ſhe ought to Renounce: Reſerving to her the foreſaid proviſion, as Accords. <hi>Caſtlehill</hi> Reporter. <hi>Gibſon</hi> Clerk.</p>

He and his Wife did thereafter enter in a Contract with another Siſter of his Wifes, who had Right to the equal half of the ſaid Tenement, as Heir portioner with her Siſter; by which Contract there was a mutual Tailȝie with conſent of the Husband; and the Right of Fie, that by the former Contract was ſettled upon her Husband, as ſaid is, was diſponed to the Wife; in ſua far as both the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, with conſent of their Husbands, were obliged to reſign their Reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive parts, in favours of their Husbands and themſelves in Liferent; and the Heirs of the Marriage in Fie; whilks Failȝieing in favours of the Wifes Heirs: Which Contract was queſtioned by a Reduction at the inſtance of a Creditor of the Husbands; upon that reaſon, that the ſaid Right of Fie granted by the ſaid Contract betwixt the Husband and the Wife, and her Siſter, was in defraud of the Husbands Creditors, and null by the Act of Parliament 1621. In ſua far as the Husband had a Fie of the ſaid Tenement, by the Contract of Marriage betwixt him and his Wife; which might have been affected with Execution at the inſtance of his Creditors; and the ſaid Fie was given, by the ſaid late Contract, to the Wife, ſo that the Husband had only a Liferent.</p>
                     <p>In this Proceſs, <hi>It was Alledged.</hi> 1. That the Act of Parliament did mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate only in the caſe of Dyvors, and Diſpoſitions granted by them. And 2. That the ſaid Act of Parliament doth only reſcind Alienations that are made without true juſt and neceſſary Cauſes; and that the ſaid Contract betwixt the Husband and his Wife, and her Siſter was made for a true and juſt Cauſe; and the Fie of the ſaid Tenement, which the Debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor had, was given away in reſpect of the Obligements of the ſaid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract in favours of the Husband the Purſuers Debitor; which was as equal as to advantages for the Purſuers Debitor, as they were for the other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; ſeing both the Siſters their parts of the Tenement were provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſame manner to the Reſpective Wives and their Husbands, and the Heirs of the Marriage; whilks failȝiening the Wifes Heirs; and that the Purſuers Debitor was a perſon opulent for the time, according to his qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; and had ſufficiency of Eſtate and Moveables otherwayes, that might have ſatisfied the Purſuers Debt the time of the ſaid laſt Contract, and thereafter: So that the ſaid Contract being valide <hi>ab initio,</hi> it could not be taken away upon pretence, that thereafter the Husband became inſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent; ſeing it cannot be ſaid, that the Husband did intend to defraud his Creditor, or that there were any fraud upon his part.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It was Replyed,</hi> That tho the caſe of Bankrupts and their fraudful pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices mentioned in the ſaid Act, being ſo frequent, did give occaſion and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:94635:195"/>
Riſe to the ſame; yet it appears evidently by the ſaid Act, that it was intended, that Debitors ſhould not be in a capacity to give away any part of their Eſtate, in prejudice of their Creditors, to any perſon; In ſua far as the diſpoſitive words of the Act are in theſe terms, that in all Cauſes at the inſtance of a true Creditor, the Lords will decern all Alienations and Rights made by the Debitor, to any conjunct perſon, without true juſt and neceſſary Cauſes, and without a juſt price really payed; the ſame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done after Contracting of lawfull Debts from true Creditors; to be null without further Declarator: And the ſaid Act does not bear, that all Rights made by Bankrupts ſhould be Null, it being hard to give a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and definition of a Bankrupt; So that diverſe queſtions may ariſe anent the notion of Bankrupt; and what Debitors ſhould be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Bankrupt; and therefore for cutting off the ſame, the Act is conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Terms foreſaid; and annulls Diſpoſitions made by Debitors without an Onerous Cauſe: And the Lords, by the Statute ratified by the ſaid Act, do declare, that they intend to follow and practiſe the Laws Civil and Canon made againſt fraudful Alienations in prejudice of Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors: And by the Civil Law, all Rights and Deeds made and done in prejudice of Creditors without an Onerous Cauſe, are null, and may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcinded <hi>actione Pauliana:</hi> And the Law doth preſume, <hi>praeſumptione Juris,</hi> that they are fraudulent, being prejudicial to Creditors <hi>ex eventu &amp; re:</hi> who are not obliged to ſay, that they are fraudful <hi>conſilio;</hi> which is <hi>in animo</hi> and hardly can be proven.</p>
                     <p>As that point, <hi>viz.</hi> That the ſaid Contract was upon valuable conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; <hi>It is Replyed,</hi> That the taking of the Fie from the Husband, and giving the ſame to the Wife; it's a Donation as to the Wife in prejudice of the Creditor; So that there is no Onerous Cauſe as to the Husband.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Lords,</hi> Upon Debate at the Barr and amongſt themſelves, did <hi>Find,</hi> that Debitors might diſpoſe of a part of their Eſtate by way of Gift, and without an Onerous Cauſe; if they retain alſe much and more than would ſatisfy their Creditors: And therefore they <hi>Found</hi> the Defence Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levant, that the Debitor had alſe much Eſtate beſides the Fie of the ſaid Tenement, as would ſatisfy the Purſuers Debt. Actor <hi>Falconer</hi> alteri <hi>Steuart. Monro</hi> Clerk. <hi>Praeſentia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some of the Lords were of the Opinion, That the caſe, being of ſo great conſequence as to the preparative; it was fit to be thought upon: and urged theſe Reaſons. 1. That the Words and Letter of the Law ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be clear, againſt Deeds done by Debitors without an Onerous Cauſe. 2. Tho our Law were not clear, yet in caſes of that nature, when we have not a Municipal Law, nor cuſtom to the contrary, we ought to follow, tho not the Authority, yet the Equity of the Civil Law, which is received every where, where there is no cuſtom to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: Specially, ſeing it is declared by the ſaid Statute mentioned in the Act of Parliament 1621, That the Lords are to follow the Civil and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non Law made againſt Deeds and Alienations in prejudice of Creditors. 3. It is hard, to put Creditors to diſpute the condition of their Debtors, the time of making Donations; and whether they had effects and ſufficiency of Eſtate to ſatisfy their Debt, notwithſtanding the ſaid Deeds; which may be unknown to the Creditors: It being ſufficient to ſay, that the Deed was without an Onerous Cauſe; and that the Debitor became inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. 4. If a Debitor ſhould become inſolvent <hi>ex poſt facto,</hi> tho the time
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:94635:195"/>
of the Donation, the reſidue of his Eſtate might have ſatisfied the Debt, It is more juſt and reaſonable that a Donator, who has a Lucrative Title, ſhould rather ſuffer <hi>ex eventu</hi> than a Creditor. <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:94635:196"/>
Miln, againſt the Feuars of the Lands, for abſtracted Multures of <hi>grana creſcentia,</hi> if the ſame ſhould import Aſtriction as to all ſuch Granes, tho neither the Right of the Feuar of the Miln, nor of the Heretors of the Lands be expreſs of <hi>grana creſcentia;</hi> but only of the Terms foreſaid <hi>cum aſtrictis multuris.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some were of the Opinion, as to the firſt point, That a Feu of a Miln in the Terms foreſaid <hi>cum aſtrictis multuris,</hi> ſhould import nothing elſe but that they that were within the ſucken and aſtriction ſhould be lyable, only to grind at the Miln all ſuch Corns that they ſhould have need and occaſion to grind; Seing Thirlages are a moſt odious ſervitude and ought to be taken ſtrictly: And Multures being <hi>Moliturae</hi> and due for grinding, they ought to be underſtood only in the caſe of Corns which the Feuers do bring to the Miln to grind; or which they have need and uſe to grind; and yet abſtract and go to other Milns: Otherwayes there ſhould be no difference betwixt the Aſtriction of <hi>grana creſcentia,</hi> and an ordinary aſtriction. 2. The caſe in queſtion was of a Miln Feued by the Abbot of <hi>Culroſs,</hi> and of Lands likewayes Feued by himſelf after the Feu of the Miln, and the time of the Feu of the Miln Lands being the Abbots own, either in mainſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or ſet to Tennents; It cannot be thought, that the Aſtriction was in other terms than ſuch as Tennents are in uſe to be aſtricted to their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Miln; and beſide the Teind and Seed, and the Duty payable to the Maſter; which being payable to the Abbot the time of the Feu of the Miln was free of aſtriction; the Tennent having the reſidue of the Rent for entertaining of his Family, and for defraying the Charges of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring, and Servants Fies; and other neceſſar Expences which could not be defrayed otherwayes, but by ſelling ſome of the Corns growing: It cannot be conceived that the Abbot or any other Maſter would aſtrict his Tennents in theſe Terms, that they ſhould be lyable for dry Multures, except it were expreſt, and that the Aſtriction had been <hi>granorum creſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium.</hi> Yet the Lords did demurr as to this point, In reſpect it was vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently urged by <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

The Proviſion was during Marriage, and after the Creditor that did compeat, his Debt; and tho it could be ſuſtained, where there was no Contract of Marriage, for a competent Proviſion; yet it could not be ſuſtained for the whole Annualrent, being exorbitant; her Husbands E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate and Debt being conſidered.</p>

                     <p>It appeared, that the ſame Defence being proponed in the foreſaid De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet 1597. for theſe who were compearing, was Repelled; In reſpect the ſaid Charter was ſo Ancient, and was ſo expreſly of the Multures of the hail Pariſh; And after ſo long a time it was not neceſſar to debate the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots Power to aſtrict the ſaid whole Pariſh: And the foreſaid Charter does bear, that the Abbot did give to the Feuer the ſaid Miln, in the ſame manner, and alſe freely as one <hi>

                     <p>It was urged by the <hi>Lords</hi> that were of an other Opinion, That the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tular of the Teinds had an <hi>intereſſe partiarium</hi> as to Teinds; ſo that albeit the Heretor may <hi>uti Jure ſuo,</hi> it is to be underſtood, that he ſhould uſe the ſame <hi>ſine injuria,</hi> without prejudice of the Titular: And if, of purpoſe to prejudge the Titular, he ſhould not Labour but ſuffer his Lands to ly waſte, he will be Lyable to the Titular for the value of the Teind that was formerly payable, or might have been gotten; As was <hi>Found</hi> in the caſe of the Laird of <hi>Polwart</hi> againſt the Miniſter of <hi>Polwart.</hi> For, If he ſhould incloſe all or a conſiderable part of his Ground that was arable Land, and whereof the Teind was either payed to, or led by the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tular, it were hard that it ſhould be in his Power to prejudge the Parſon to the advantage of the Viccar; But in that caſe the ſmall Teinds would be conſidered, as great and parſonage Teinds, <hi>quia ſurrogatum ſapit na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turam ſurrogati:</hi> And far leſs, it ought to be in the Power of an Heretor to prejudge altogether the Titular or the Miniſter, who is provided out of the Teinds, as in the caſe in queſtion, by encloſeing Ground former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly arable, and making that uſe of it, that neither the Titular nor Parſon can have any benefite of Teind; It being unjuſt, that the Titular ſhould be prejudged, and that the Heretor ſhould advantage himſelf; and by his own Deed ſhould free himſelf of Teind: And albeit, by the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom in ſome places, Teind is not payed for Carrets and Roots in Yards, the ſame being looked upon as inconſiderable; and the Bounds, where the ſame are Sowen or planted, being ſmall parcels of Ground, for the private uſe of the Heretors own Family; yet when a conſiderable Tract of Ground is encloſed and parked, ſo that the Heretor has the ſame if not more profite than he has of his other Laboured Ground, by ſelling the Roots and Fruits of the ſame, as about <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> or other great Cities where great parcels of Corn-Land are taken in, and encloſed to the uſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid; as by the Common Law Teind is payable, even for ſuch Fruits and Profits; So by our Law, the Titular ought not to be prejudged: And the cuſtom, that Teind is not payable, for Roots and ſuch like, ought to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of ſuch as grow in Yeards about Houſes, as ſaid is, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and domeſtick uſe of Heretor or Tennent; but not where a great par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of Ground is taken in, and deſtinate for profite and advantage, by Soweing, or Setting, and Selling Herbs and Roots.</p>

were of the Opinion, that the Husband could not diſpoſe of the Conqueſt but for Onerous Cauſes, yet others thought, that he might diſpoſe thereof, without fraud and for Rational Cauſes and Conſiderations; as in the caſe in queſtion, upon the conſiderations abovementioned, in favours of a dutiful Wife; And it was ſo ſound by the Major part; albeit others thought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that the Husband, notwithſtanding of the foreſaid Clauſes, might provide a ſecond Wife and his Children by her, out of the Conqueſt dure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt Marriage; if he had no other Eſtate, and the Proviſions be competent; But that in the caſe in queſtion, the Deed foreſaid was a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which the Children of the firſt Marriage, being Creditors by the ſaid Clauſe of Conqueſt, might queſtion.</p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Lords Found,</hi> That if the ſaid Deed was on Death-bed, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>funct having not only granted an Heretable Right, but having obliged himſelf, his Heirs and Executors, to pay the ſaid Sum, his Executry and Deads part would be lyable to the ſaid Obligement; even as to Moveables acquired dureing the firſt Marriage; which may appear not to be without difficulty; ſeing, as to the Conqueſt, during the firſt Marriage, there could be no Deads-part; the ſame being provided to the Children of the firſt Marriage, as ſaid is.</p>

                     <p>A Compryſing being deduced at the Inſtance of an Aſſigney, againſt the Repreſentative of the Debitor as lawfully charged; and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſer upon his Infeftment having intented a purſute for Mails and Duties;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It was Alledged,</hi> That the Cedent was debitor to the Defunct, ſo that the Debt due to the Defunct, did compenſe the Debt due by him; and the Ground of the Compryſing being ſatisfied, the Compryſing is extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Which caſe being Reported to the Lords, they had theſe Points in debate, and conſideration amongſt themſelves. <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation is only of perſonal Debts, and of Sums of Money, <hi>de liquido in liquidum;</hi> but is not receivable in the caſe of Real Rights and Lands, and Purſutes upon the ſame; Seing in ſuch proceſses there is no Debt craved, but the purſute is founded upon a Real Right: And ſome of the Lords be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enclined to think, that the Alledgance is not founded upon Compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but upon Payment or the Equivalent, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Cedent <hi>habebat intus;</hi> and in effect, and upon the matter was ſatisfied, being Debitor in alſe much as was due to him by the Defunct: And the Lords are in uſe to favour Debitors, whoſe Lands are Compriſed; and, in order to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh Compriſings, to ſuſtain proceſs for Compt and Reckoning; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring the ſame to be extinct, not only by Intromiſſion but by Compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation: Others were of the Opinion, that tho Compenſation <hi>ipſo jure minuit &amp; tollit obligationem,</hi> where it is proponed; yet if the ſame be not propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before the Decreet, whereupon the Compryſing proceeds; and when both Debts are <hi>in finibus</hi> of a perſonal Obligement; the Debt contained in the Compryſing cannot be ſaid to have been payed before the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pryſing;
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:94635:213"/>
and after the Compryſing is deduced, it cannot be extinguiſhed but either by Intromiſſion within the Years of the Legal, or by Redemption. 2. Whatever may be pretended as to the Cedent, that he could not be in <hi>bona fide</hi> to compryſe for a Debt due to him, having alſe much in his hand as would ſatisfy the ſame, yet ſuch pretences are not competent againſt the Third Perſon having <hi>bona fide</hi> compryſed; or having <hi>Jus quaeſitum;</hi> As in the caſe of a Horning upon a Decreet, it could not be obtruded to the Donator, that the Debt was ſatisfied; The Obtainer of the Decreet being Debitor to the Defender: And if this ſhould be ſuſtained, expired Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pryſings and Infeftments thereupon, being now a moſt ordinary ſurety, may be eaſily ſubverted upon pretence, that the Cedent was Debitor, in Sums equivalent, to the perſon, againſt whom the Compryſing is deduced: And there is a great difference betwixt payment and ſatisfaction, either by actual payment of the Debt, or by Intromiſſion with the Maills and Duties of the Lands compryſed, which is obvious and eaſie to be known; and betwixt the pretence of ſatisfaction by Compenſation; ſeing payment is <hi>exceptio in rem,</hi> and extinguiſheth Debts as to all effects; and Intromiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is ſo notour, that the Buyer may and ought to take notice of the ſame; whereas Compenſation is but <hi>quaſi ſolutio,</hi> and it has never effect, until it be proponed.</p>
                     <p>That point was alſo in conſideration with the <hi>Lords,</hi> Whether Compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation can be proponed by any perſon, but ſuch as has Right to the Debt? And as to this point, there were different Opinions, and ſome of the <hi>Lords</hi> were of the Judgement, that any perſon, having intereſt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend againſt Compryſings and purſuites upon the ſame, might alledge they were ſatisfied in manner foreſaid: But others were of the Opinion, that no perſon can pretend to compence, but he that could diſcharge the Debt, whereupon he would compence; and conſequently muſt have Right to the ſame: And in the caſe in queſtion, neither a confirmed Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, containing the Debt due to the Defunct, nor any Right to the ſame was produced.</p>

                     <p>IN the Caſe, <hi>Alexander Crauford</hi> contra Sir <hi>Lodovick Gordon,</hi> The <hi>Lords</hi> thought the point in queſtion. <hi>viz.</hi> Whether or not, a Backbond be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing granted by the Compryſer, the time that he did receive an Aſſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereupon he Compryſed; or by a perſon having gotten a Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, did affect the ſaid Rights, not only as to the Granters of ſuch Back-bonds, and their Repreſentatives, but likewayes as to Singular Succeſſors; And if the ſame ſhould be Found to affect, if it did affect only while the ſaid Right was perſonal, and before Infeftment, but not after?</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Lords</hi> thought the ſaid point, to be of that importance as to the Conſequence and Intereſt of the People, that it was recommended, that they ſhould have their thoughts thereupon, to the effect that the ſame may be decided with great conſideration; And accordingly, this day, the caſe being fully debated among themſelves, It was carryed and found by plurality of Votes, That ſuch Back-bonds do affect, even as to a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Succeſſor, tho <hi>extra corpus Juris;</hi> And albeit they be granted after the receiving of ſuch Rights; And that they affect Compryſings, even after Infeftments has followed thereupon, during the Legal, but not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Diverſe of the <hi>Lords</hi> did Argue and Vote againſt the ſaid Deciſion, and in ſpecial, <hi>A. I. C. N. B. S. T,</hi> Upon theſe Grounds. 1. A Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Succeſſor does not ſucceed, <hi>in univerſum Jus</hi> as an Heir, but only <hi>in Jus Singulare;</hi> And if the ſaid <hi>Jus</hi> be ſimple and pure, without any quality <hi>in corpore Juris;</hi> any extrinſick quality or Deed may bind the Granter and his Heirs, but not the Singular Succeſſor, who neither can, nor is obliged to know, and take notice of any quality that is not in the Right. 2. The quality of a Right is an Accident of the ſame, and <hi>Accidentis eſſe eſt ineſſe;</hi> So that, in Law, where the ſame is not <hi>in corpore Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> it doth not affect the Right as to Singular Succeſſors. 3. Upon the Conſiderations foreſaid, Reverſions, and Bonds for Granting Reverſions, do not militate againſt a Singular Succeſſor, unleſs they be <hi>in corpore Juris,</hi> or Regiſtrate; And tho there be an expreſs Statute to that purpoſe, yet it doth not follow <hi>a contrario,</hi> where there is no Statute, Back-bonds ſhould affect; ſeing the ſaid Statute is made, conform to the Common Law, and is Declaratory as to Reverſions; being then moſt in contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Parliament, but doth not derogate from the Common Law in other Caſes. 4. Back-bonds are upon the matter Reverſions and do oblige only to make a Retroceſſion in favours of the Cedent; and cannot operate more, than if a formal Retroceſſion were made in favours of the Cedent; which could not prejudge a Singular Succeſſor, unleſs it were intimate. 5. It would be an irrepairable prejudice to the People, and to Singular Succeſſors, who, finding a Right pure without any quality are <hi>in bona fide</hi> to think, that they may ſecurely take a Right thereto; And yet ſhould have no remedy, if, upon pretence of Back-bonds, and Deeds altogether extrinſick, their Right may be queſtioned. 6. As to the pretence of the prejudice to the People, <hi>viz.</hi> That they are in uſe to grant Aſſignations, in order to the deduceing of Compryſings thereupon; and may be fruſtrate, if the Back-bond ſhould not affect the ſame, is of no weight; Seing they truſt the Aſſigneys; And it is their own fault, if
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:94635:217"/>
they Truſt perſons that doe not deſerve Truſt; And they have a Remedy by intimateing the Back-bonds, which, upon the matter are Tranſlations; whereas a Singular Succeſſor has none. 7. That ſuch Back-bonds ſhould affect Compryſings, not only before, but after Infeftment during the Legal; But thereafter ſhould ceaſe to qualify the ſame; It ſeems to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with, and againſt the principles of Law. <hi>In praeſentia.</hi>

                     <p>It is Thought, That if the Appeirand Heir ſhould <hi>doloſe</hi> grant a Bond, that the Defuncts Eſtate might be thereupon adjudged, ought to be Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>in ſolidum:</hi> But if he grant a Bond which is a lawful Deed, and thereupon his Creditor adjudge, which he could not hinder; It is hard to ſuſtaine a paſſive Title againſt him; unleſs his creditor, having ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged,

That Interdictions, by the Common Law, are only of <hi>prodigi;</hi> And Interdictors are in effect given <hi>Curatores</hi> to them: And, by our cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, albeit Interdictions are granted <hi>ſine cauſae Cognitione,</hi> upon Bonds granted by perſons interdicted, upon that conſideration and narrative, that they are perſons facile, and not fit to manage their Eſtate; whereupon the Judge preſumes, that they are ſuch; and upon a Bill gives warrand to publiſh the ſame; yet the Interdiction in queſtion ought not to be ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſeing it is not the ordinary ſtile of other Interdictions; and the Bond of Interdiction bears no narrative of Facility; but only that the Granter, for the ſtanding of his Family, being very Ancient, did oblige himſelf not to Diſpone his Eſtate without conſent of the Perſons thereinmentioned, and Letters of Publication were not raiſed thereupon, but Inhibition was only uſed.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That Interdictions are a Remedy, for ſecureing weak perſons, and ought not to be a ſnare to others: And the Law favours, and helps theſe that are <hi>decepti,</hi> and not <hi>decipientes:</hi> And that the Purſuer was in effect circumveened, in ſwa far as, the ſaid Interdiction was not Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate till the Purſuer was in Terms of Bargaining; and they had ſearched the Regiſters, and had not found any ſuch Interdiction; and the only In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdictor on Life, was Witneſs to the Bargain, and got a part of the price; and the reſt of the price was payed to Creditors anterior to the Interdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; And the Purſuer, relying upon the Ingenuity of the Diſponer, tho he might have ſecured himſelf by taking a Right to the ſaid Debts, did extinguiſh the ſame, by taking Diſcharges and Renounciatons.</p>

                     <p>And whereas it was pretended by the Defenders, that Salt is neceſſary for the curing of their Fiſhes. The <hi>Lords Found,</hi> That Manufacture, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the Acts of Parliament, is only to be underſtood of Works e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by Companies or others for making of Cloath, or ſuch like; about which many poor People are Employed and Entertained: And tho there be skill in cureing Herring, they are not a Manufacture, but a Native Commodity, without any alteration of the form, and only qualified by the cureing of the ſame: And that, upon that pretence, the Defenders ought not to be allowed to import Salt: But was Recommended to ſome of the Lords, being alſo upon the Council, to move that a courſe might be taken for Regulateing the price of Salt; that it be not Arbitrary to the Royal Burrowes, to ſell the ſame at ſuch Rates, as the Burghs of Barony cannot, without prejudice, buy the ſame; So that they may be forced to deſiſt from making or exporting Herring.</p>

                     <p>Some of the Lords were of another Opinion, as to this Point, and thought, that ſeing the late Act of Parliament, doth mention only the caſe of unlawful Goods deprehended; and doth regulate the former Practice, as to the attaching and affecting of the ſame; and it is inconſiſtent, that both the Goods deprehended ſhould be eſcheat, and likeways the Contraveen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers

                     <p>THE Lord <hi>Balmerinoch</hi> was purſued, as Repreſenting and Behaving as Heir to the Lord <hi>Couper,</hi> at the Inſtance of <hi>Margaret Nevoy,</hi> and diverſe other Creditors of the ſaid Lord <hi>Couper;</hi> upon that Ground, that he had ratified a Diſpoſition, made by the ſaid Lord <hi>Couper,</hi> in favours of his Lady on Death-bed; and was obliged to compriſe the ſaids Lands, and to give the ſaid Lady a Right to the Compryſing, to be deduced, that ſhould be preferable to other Creditors; And that by the Act of <hi>Sederunt</hi> in my Lord <hi>Nithſdales</hi> Caſe, appearand Heirs, granting Bonds to the effect their Predeceſſors Eſtate may be eſtabliſhed in their Perſon or in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſome Confident to their behoof, are lyable as Behaving: and <hi>It was Alledged</hi> for the Defender, that Behaving is <hi>magis animi quam facti,</hi> and it is evident that the Defender did ſhune to be Heir; and did of purpoſe take the Courſe foreſaid, that he ſhould not repreſent the defunct.</p>

                        <hi>The Lords Found,</hi> That the Condeſcendence was only relevant in theſe Terms, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Defender, or any Confident to his behoof, had compriſed the ſaid Eſtate for <hi>Balmerinoch</hi>'s own Debt; and had poſſeſt by vertue of the Compryſing: Or that the Lord <hi>Balmerinoch</hi> had commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate the Right of the ſaid Compryſing to the Lady <hi>Couper;</hi> and that ſhe had poſſeſt by vertue thereof; and could not defend her ſelf with her own Right as being <hi>in Lecto,</hi> Or otherwayes defective.</p>
                     <p>It was the Opinion of ſome of the <hi>Lords,</hi> That it was ſufficient and Relevant to ſay, that <hi>Balmerinoch</hi> had Compryſed for his own Debt; and was obliged to Communicate the ſaid Compryſing; and had ratified the Lady <hi>Couper</hi>'s Right: For theſe Reaſons. 1. The Law conſiders <hi>quod agitur,</hi> and not <hi>quod ſimulate concipitur;</hi> And the Lord <hi>Balmerinoch,</hi> by tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the courſe foreſaid to compryſe for his own Debt, intends upon the matter <hi>adire,</hi> and to carry away his Uncles Eſtate, to fruſtrate Creditors. 2. Tho it be pretended, that there is a difference betwixt <hi>Nithſdal</hi>'s Caſe and this, In reſpect in that caſe, the Adjudication was upon Bonds grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by himſelf, after his Fathers deceaſe; And, in this, the Compryſing is for my Lord <hi>Balmerinoch</hi>'s Debts, Contracted before my Lord <hi>Couper</hi>'s Death; The ſaid difference is not conſiderable, ſeing as to that caſe, there was a deſign to carry away the Defuncts Eſtate, by a Deed of the Appearand Heir, to the prejudice of Creditors; and there is the ſame in this. 3. Tho my Lord <hi>Balmerinoch</hi> had granted only a Ratification, without Communicating any Right; <hi>eo ipſo</hi> he behaved as Heir; In reſpect he had ratified the Ladies Right, for any Right or Intereſt he had himſelf; and he had an Intereſt, as Appearand Heir, ſufficient to eſtabliſh a Right in the Perſon of the ſaid Lady, and to prejudge Creditors; ſo that they could not queſtion the ſame; Seing Rights on Death-bed, being conſented to by the Appearand Heir when they are made, or <hi>ex poſt facto,</hi> become valid and unqueſtionable <hi>ex capite Lecti,</hi> as appears by the Law of the <hi>Majeſty,</hi> concerning Rights on Death-bed.</p>

                     <p>THE Lord <hi>Bamff,</hi> having acquired the Lands of <hi>Craigſtoun</hi> from <hi>John Lyon,</hi> did give three Bonds to the ſaid <hi>John Lyon</hi> Blank in the

Creditors Name, containing each of them 5000 <hi>Merks;</hi> And, at the deſire of the ſaid <hi>John,</hi> did give a Letter with the ſaid Bonds with a Blank direction, bearing that the ſaid <hi>John Lyon,</hi> having Diſponed to him the Lands of <hi>Craigſtoun,</hi> for which he had become Debitor by certain Blank Bonds containing 5000 <hi>Merks;</hi> And therefore deſireing that no perſon might ſcruple to take the ſaid Bonds; For it ſhould be no diſſatisfaction to him, that they took them without acquainting him; but that it ſhould be holden, as if they had received the Bonds in the beginning, and had their Names filled up therein at that time.</p>
                     <p>The ſaid <hi>John Lyon</hi> did fill up the Name of <hi>John Grant</hi> of <hi>Roſollis</hi> in the ſaid Bonds; and delivered the ſaid Letter to him, putting a direction upon the ſame, for the ſaid <hi>John Grant:</hi> Whereupon the Lord <hi>Bamff</hi> being charged did Suſpend, upon that reaſon, that he ought to have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, becauſe the ſaid Bonds were granted for the price of the ſaid Lands and in contemplation of a valid ſurety, free of all Incumberances; and the ſurety not being valid, In reſpect the Lands were affected with Hornings, Inhibitions, and Compryſings, equivalent to the Sums contained in the Bonds; he had in Law Condiction, as being <hi>ob cauſam non ſecutam.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Lords alſo Found,</hi> That the ſaid Bonds being Blank, tho they continued Blank, were the ſaid <hi>John Lyons</hi> proper Bonds; and if he had deceaſed before the filling up of the ſame, they would have fallen under his Executry; and conſequently, he being Rebel and his Eſcheat gifted and declared, they fell under his Eſcheat: And His Majeſty, and the Donator could not be prejudged by any Deed of the Rebel, in filling up of the ſame.</p>

                     <p>IN a Declarator of a Liferent-Eſcheat; <hi>It was Alledged,</hi> That there could be no Eſcheat upon the Horning Lybelled; Becauſe it was upon Letters direct by the Secret Council, upon a Decreet of a Regali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Court; And by the Acts of Parliament, The Lords of Seſſion are only warranted, to direct Letters of Horning ſummarly, upon the Decreets of Sheriffs, and Baillies of Regality, and other Inferior Judges.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Lords</hi> Thought, That the Council could not direct Letters of Horning upon the ſaid Decreet; Seing, before the Acts of Parliament, Letters of Horning could not be direct upon the Decreets of Inferiour Judges ſummarly, without a Decreet <hi>Conforme</hi> before the Lords of Seſſion; And Statutes being <hi>Stricti Juris,</hi> the Council could not direct Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, unleſs by the ſame Statute they had been warranted to that effect; and it appears, that the ſaid Statute was founded upon good Reaſon and Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, tho they be not expreſt, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Lords of Seſſion are always ſitting in the time of Seſſion; and in vacance, there is ſome of their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber appointed to receive and paſs Bills of Suſpenſion, if there be cauſe; whereas the Council ſitteth but once a Week ordinarly in Seſſion-time; and in Vacance but thrice. 2. The Lords do not paſs Suſpenſions but upon good Reaſons, and they are to conſider the ſaid Decreets, which is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the Council. 3. As Suſpenſions are raiſed of the ſaid Decreets, ſo oft times there is a neceſſity of raiſing Reductions; and the Lords of Council are not competent Judges to the Reduction of the ſaid Decreets: But the Lords thought not fit, that there ſhould be a queſtion betwixt them and the Council, concerning their Priviledge; and therefore did forbear to give anſwer, until ſome accommodation ſhould be endeavoured: And it was propoſed by ſome, that the Decreet of the Regality Court, being for keeping of Conventicles; and that practice, concerning ſo much the Peace of the Countrey, that all Diſturbance thereby might be prevented; and upon that account, it being recommended to the Council, by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that they ſhould ſee the Laws againſt Conventicles put effectually in execution; The Council, as they might conveen the Contraveeners be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore themſelves, may commiſſionate the Inferiour Courts to proceed as their Delegats; and upon their Decreets given by them as their Delegats, that they may direct Letters of Horning. <hi>Theſaurer-depute</hi> Reporter.</p>

That the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender had Marryed the time of the Uſurpation, at which time the Caſuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Ward and Marriage were taken away by an Act and Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Uſurpers, whereby the Defender was ſecured and was <hi>in bona fide</hi> to Marry without requireing the Superiors Conſent. 2. <hi>De facto</hi> the Superior had conſented to his Marriage, In ſwa far as the Defender having given notice to him by a Letter, the Marqueſs of <hi>Argyle</hi> being then at <hi>London,</hi> that he was to Marry with a Gentle-Woman, who is now his Wife, the Marqueſs did return a Letter (which was produced) ſhowing that he could not but approve his matching with the ſaid Gentle-Woman being the Laird of <hi>Ardkindles</hi> Daughter; and if they ſhould proceed to the Marriage, that he wiſhed them well.</p>
                     <p>Whereunto, <hi>It was Replyed,</hi> That the Uſurpers by their Act could not prejudge the Purſuer, or any other Superior, but that they might claim the Obventions and Caſualities, that did fall unto them, by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their Vaſſals Right; as it was found in the caſe of Sir <hi>George Kina<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Upon Debate at the Bar and among the Lords, Some were of the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that there being no Contempt that could be alledged of the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or; and the Vaſſal having ſo much reaſon to think, that he needed not his Conſent, In reſpect the ſaid Act was a Law <hi>de facto,</hi> and for the time; the whole Country being forced to ſubmit to the Uſurpers, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce to their Orders; That <hi>Communis error facit Jus,</hi> and <hi>quaevis cauſa excuſat</hi> as to Caſualities ariſing upon feudal Delinquency or Contempt: And the Superiors Intereſt, that was intended of the Law, was not that he ſhould have a Sum of Money, but that his Vaſſal ſhould not Marry with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Conſent, and match with Families either diſaffected, or in which the Superior could not have confidence; and the avail of Marriage is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal in caſe the Vaſſal ſhould either Marry without the Superiors conſent, or ſhould refuſe to Marry a perſon profered by the Superior to be his Wife.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="204" facs="tcp:94635:227"/>Upon the foreſaid Conſiderations, they were of Opinion, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence was relevant; and that there was a great difference betwixt the caſe of Recognition and Marriage, in regard the reaſon of the Deciſion in the caſe foreſaid, was, that the Vaſſal did upon the matter contemn the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior, after the Kings Reſtitution, ſeing he did not apply for a Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Whereas the Vaſſal, being once married, it were to no purpoſe to deſire the Superiors Conſent.</p>
                     <p>On the other part, ſome of the Lords argued, that the ſingle Avail is not penal, but only the double; ſeing the Vaſſal, attaining to the age of marriage, if he ſhould die unmaryed, yet the ſingle avail would be due: Whereunto <hi>It was Anſwered,</hi> That <hi>poena</hi> is in Law, when a Perſon is ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to pay a Sum, either for doing or not doing a Deed; and as the Vaſſal is lyable to the double Avail, for refuſeing the Perſon offered by the Superior, ſo he is lyable to the ſingle for not marrying, and tho <hi>matrimonia</hi> are <hi>libera,</hi> ſo that a Perſon may marry or not as he pleaſes, yet <hi>cauſative</hi> many things are allowed, which cannot be directly: And it being the deſign of the Feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal Law, and Superiors, in giving out their Lands, to have ſtill Vaſſals to ſerve them and their Family, the appearand Heir is obliged by the nature of his Holding to marry, or <hi>in poenam</hi> to pay the avail: and if the Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal ſhould deſire his Superior to offer him a Perſon that he might marry, or to conſent that he ſhould marry, ſuch a Perſon as he thought fit for him; and the Superior ſhould refuſe both, it were hard, that notwithſtanding the Vaſſal ſhould be lyable to pay the Avail of his marriage.</p>

                     <p>SIR <hi>Archibald Stewart</hi> of <hi>Caſtlemilk,</hi> having purſued a Reduction of a Diſpoſition of the Lands of <hi>Coats,</hi> made by <hi>James Stewart</hi> of <hi>Minto,</hi> in favours of Sir <hi>John Whitefoord; ex capite metus:</hi> In ſwa far as, the ſaid Sir <hi>John Whitefoord</hi> had taken the ſaid <hi>James</hi> and kept him <hi>in privato car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere</hi> for ſome time; and thereafter, having a Caption againſt him, had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained him Priſoner: and had cauſed tranſport and convey him in that condition, from diverſe places in the night Seaſon; and by his Servants had threatned him with long Impriſonment; and in end had prevailed
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:94635:229"/>
with him to diſpone to him the ſaids Lands, being eight Chalders Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of Rent, and where there was a Coal of 100. <hi>lib. ſterl.</hi> of Rent; upon an Obligement only to pay him an yearly Annuity of 400. <hi>merks:</hi> In which proceſs, the ſaid Sir <hi>John,</hi> and Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> who had thereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter acquired the ſaid Lands from the ſaid Sir <hi>John,</hi> did compear, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone the Defences following. 1. That the foreſaid Qualifications of Force were not Relevant to import <hi>metus, qui poteſt cadere in Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem virum,</hi> being neither <hi>mortis</hi> nor <hi>Cruciatus;</hi> nor ſo circumſtantiate, as is required of the Law, for founding the ſaid Action. And 2 That albeit <hi>metus</hi> were relevantly qualified, the foreſaid Deed cannot be queſtioned upon pretence of the ſame, unleſs the ſaid <hi>James Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>art</hi> had been leſed or damnified by the ſame; Seing it appears by the Title, <hi>quod metus cauſa,</hi> &amp;c. A Reduction and Reſtitution upon that head is not competent, <hi>ubi non eſt damnum, &amp; nihil abeſt;</hi> as is clear by diverſe Texts, in the caſe of a Creditor uſeing force to get what is unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly due to him; and in this caſe the ſaid <hi>James</hi> had no prejudice, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect he was obliged by an antecedent Minute to diſpon the ſaid Lands: ſo that the ſaid Diſpoſition was but for implement of the ſaid Minute, which the ſaid Sir <hi>John</hi> did give back to be cancelled by <hi>Minto,</hi> when he got the ſaid Diſpoſition. And 3. It was offered to be proven, that, after the ſaid <hi>James</hi> was at liberty, the ſaid Diſpoſition was granted by him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Lords Found,</hi> That the Libel and Qualifications of <hi>metus</hi> and Force were relevant; and yet, in reſpect the Defenders were ſo poſitive as to their Alledgance, that the Diſponer was at liberty when he granted the ſaid Right; they allowed a conjunct Probation concerning the ſaid Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Force, and the condition the Diſponer was in for the time, and the way of granting the ſaid Right; whether he was under Reſtraint and the Impreſſion of Fear, or in Freedom? Or whether the ſamen was granted by him freely and voluntarly?</p>
                     <p>As to the ſaid other Defence, that there was no <hi>damnum,</hi> the Lords re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled the ſame; and would not allow that point of Fact to be tryed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or not there were a former Minute, for Implement of which the ſaid Right was granted? And whether it was given back for, and the time of the granting of the ſaid Diſpoſition?</p>
                     <p>Some of the Lords were of the Opinion, That the Qualifications libelled, were not relevant to import ſuch a force and <hi>metus,</hi> as could be the ground of a Reduction of the ſaid Right; <hi>ex eo capite;</hi> tho they were convinced that the practice foreſaid is moſt unwarrantable and <hi>doloſa;</hi> and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Right may be queſtioned as to Sir <hi>John</hi> himſelf, but not as to a ſingular Succeſſor: and that there is a difference betwixt a Reduction <hi>ex capite metus,</hi> which is competent againſt ſingular Succeſſors; and a Reduction <hi>ex capite doli,</hi> which is not competent againſt a ſingular Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, who <hi>bona fide</hi> has acquired a Right, for an Onerous Cauſe.</p>
                     <p>But diverſe of the Lords were of Opinion, that the Defence foreſaid, that there was no <hi>damnum,</hi> was moſt relevant, for theſe Reaſons; <hi>viz.</hi> All Reſtitutions upon what <hi>mediums</hi> ſoever, whether <hi>metus</hi> or <hi>dolus,</hi> or <hi>lubricum aetatis,</hi> are againſt <hi>damnum</hi> and prejudice; for <hi>fruſtra</hi> ſhould Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution be craved, if there be no <hi>damnum.</hi> 2. It is evident by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Laws, and the Title foreſaid, <hi>quod metus,</hi> &amp;c. That <hi>ex edicto quod metus cauſa,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>non datur actio ſi nihil abſit; &amp; ſuccurritur</hi> only <hi>captis &amp;
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:94635:229"/>
laeſis.</hi> 3. By the Civil Law, there were diverſe Remedies competent to theſe who had been forced to do any deed; <hi>viz.</hi> A Civil action <hi>ex Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto Praetoris,</hi> and a Criminal Action <hi>ex lege Julia;</hi> and a Penal Remedy <hi>ex decreto Divi Marci,</hi> That a Creditor by force, extorting what is truely due, <hi>amittit Jus Crediti:</hi> And our Reductions <hi>ex capite metus</hi> are but Civil Actions, as that <hi>ex Edicto:</hi> And the ſaid other Remedies being pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, by the Municipal Law of the <hi>Romans,</hi> cannot be introduced by the Lords of Seſſion being Civil Judges, without an Act of Parliament. 4. All Reſtitutions ſhould Repone both Parties <hi>in integrum;</hi> and it were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, that if it were conſtant, and the Lords were convinced upon their own certain knowledge, that there had been an antecedent Minute, and that the ſame had been cancelled upon the granting of the ſaid Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that <hi>Minto</hi> ſhould be reſtored, and not the ſaid Sir <hi>John;</hi> that now <hi>res non eſt integra,</hi> ſeing the antecedent Minute is not Extant; and tho it were Extant, it would be ineffectual, In reſpect <hi>Minto</hi> has Diſponed the foreſaid Lands to this Purſuer who is Infeft; and, having the firſt Infeft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would be preferable, whether the Minute were Extant or not. 5. As to the pretence that was ſo much urged, that it would be of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous conſequence, that ſuch Deeds extorted by force ſhould be ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the pretext of <hi>non damnum;</hi> and that it would tend to encourage ſuch practices, the ſame is of no weight; ſeing the Deed, being juſt upon the matter, may and ought to be ſuſtained, and yet the way of procureing the ſame may be ſeverely puniſhed. 6. As to the difficulty of Probation, there being no Adminicles in Write, that there were ſuch a Minute, It is not conſiderable; Seing <hi>multa permittuntur cauſative,</hi> which cannot be done directly; and that tho the Reſult of Probation by Witneſſes, may be the making up or taking away of Writes, which cannot be done direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but by Write; yet when that which is to be proven is in Fact, it may be proven by Witneſſes; as in the ſame caſe, that the Diſpoſition in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion was Extorted, it may be proven by Witneſſes, to take away the ſaid Diſpoſition: And if a perſon ſhould be forced to grant a Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Lands of 20. Chalders of Victual of Rent, and in Exchange ſhould get a Diſpoſition at the ſame time of other Lands of the half value, it were a good Defence and probable by Witneſſes, that the Purſuer did get, the time of the granting the Diſpoſition of Lands, worth 20 Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Victual, a Diſpoſition of leſs value; and <hi>Contingentia cauſae</hi> and of a Tranſaction and circumſtances of the ſame, ought not to be divided; but may and ought to be entirely proven by Witneſſes, alſe well for the Defender as the Purſuer.

                     <p>It appears indeed, that the Commiſſars have not power to Fyne; that being a Criminal Juriſdiction; and that they are not Judges to Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation by the indirect manner; The Tryal of Falſehood, by circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and preſumptions, being <hi>Altioris Indaginis;</hi> and of that Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, that it ought not to be left to an Inferiour Judge. <hi>Item,</hi> The Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of Falſehood, as to that effect that Falſaries may be puniſhed, ought not to be by any Inferior Judge; But it ſeems to be juſt and neceſſary, that Parties, grieved by ſuch Decreets, ſhould be allowed to purſue the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the ſame, to hear and ſee them reponed againſt the ſaid Decreets, upon that Ground that they were not cited to the ſame; to be proven by the Witneſſes and Executer himſelf, declaring that they purſue to that effect allanerly: And it appears not to be inconſiſtent with Law and Form, that this courſe ſhould be taken; ſeing the Judge does not reduce his own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet, <hi>ex capite iniquitatis;</hi> and it may be provided, that ſuch Purſutes, tho they be upon the matter Improbations, are only to the effect foreſaid; and that no other effect or conſequence ſhall follow upon the ſame; and <hi>multa fiunt per indirectum,</hi> which cannot be directly: And if a Party, who is holden as confeſt, ſhould raiſe a lybel before an Inferior Judge, that it may be Found that he was not <hi>Contumax,</hi> being out of the Countrey, or Sick, or detained by Storm, or ſome other inſuperable Impediment; and that therefore he ſhould be reponed; and the Decreet ſhould be holden as a Lybel; ſuch a Purſute would not be incompetent, tho in effect it would be a Reduction upon the matter.</p>

                     <p>It occurred to ſome of the <hi>Lords</hi> and was moved, whether <hi>Juramentum in litem,</hi> being given to the Party wronged; and upon that account, that the quantities and the Kinds of Goods, taken from him, could not be ſo well known to others and proven; if the ſame be a perſonal favour; Or if it may be extended to an Aſſigney? <hi>Newbyth</hi> Reporter.</p>

That there could be no Ground of Declarator, in reſpect the Diſponer had not made uſe of the ſaid Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor granted a Wadſet for the ſaid Sum; and that the Defunct had a perſonal Eſtate and Executry; And in ſwa far as, he had not, conform to the ſaid faculty, ſecured the Purſuer out of the ſaid Lands, he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his Intention, not to make uſe of the ſaid faculty.</p>

But there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after in an Improbation of the ſaid Aſſignation, at the inſtance of the ſaid <hi>Janet Mcmath,</hi> the ſaid Sir <hi>Laurence</hi> having abiden by the ſame, It was <hi>Found,</hi> after a long and litigious dependence by the ſpace of 50 Years, that the Aſſignation was falſe: And <hi>William Dick</hi> of <hi>Grange,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Janet</hi> her Son, having thereafter intented a purſute againſt the ſaid Sir <hi>Laurence,</hi> to hear and ſee it declared, that in reſpect the ſaid Sir <hi>Laurence,</hi> by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and making uſe of the ſaid falſe Aſſignation, had been prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and had rendered the foreſaid Diligence by Arreſtment ineffectual; and had tranſacted and made benefite of the ſaid falſe Aſſignation; That therefore, In ſwa far as he was <hi>Lucratus</hi> he ſhould make the ſame forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming for payment of the Purſuers juſt Debt; Eſpecially it being conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that he had Diſcharged one of the Cautioners in <hi>Drumkilbo</hi> his Bond: <hi>It was Anſwered,</hi> That he was <hi>in bona fide</hi> to acquire a Right to the ſaid Aſſignation, neither knowing, nor being acceſſory to the Forgeing of the ſame; and he had made no benefite by uplifting from <hi>Drumkilbo</hi> any part of the ſaid Debt; but by transferring his Right in favours of Mr. <hi>John Blair;</hi> which he had done <hi>bona fide:</hi> And as to the Diſcharging the Cautioner, it could not prejudge the Purſuer, ſeing the Diſcharge would fall in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the Aſſignation.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Lords Found,</hi> That, albeit he were not acceſſory to the Forgery, yet having uſed a falſe Write, and having litigiouſly ſo long maintained the ſame; and upon that occaſion, the Purſuer be ng altogether fruſtrate; he ought to be Lyable <hi>in quantum lucratus,</hi> and what he had gotten more by the Tranſaction with Mr. <hi>George Blair</hi> then he had given for acquire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſaid Right: And the <hi>Lords</hi> reſerved Action to the Purſuer againſt the Cautioner: And in caſe the Cautioner ſhould be Aſſoilȝied, without prejudice to have recourſe againſt the ſaid Sir <hi>Laurence</hi> as Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords.

                     </head>
                     <p>MR. <hi>Cornelius Inglis</hi> being Debitor to Mr. <hi>John Inglis</hi> of <hi>Cramond</hi> in the Sum of 3500. <hi>Merks;</hi> He did give to <hi>Cramond,</hi> for Security of the ſaid Sum, and for relief of Cautionries for him, extending to towards 10000 <hi>M.</hi> a Bond for payment and relieving him of the ſaid Sums; with an obligement to Infeft in the Lands thereinmentioned, for his Security and relief of the ſaid Sums; and a precept of Saſine whereupon Infeftment fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed: And thereafter, Mr. <hi>Patrick Inglis,</hi> the ſaid Mr. <hi>Cornelius</hi> his Eldeſt Son, did grant a Bond to <hi>Cramond,</hi> relateing expreſly to the ſaid former Bond and Right of Relief, and in Corroboration thereof, and the Infeftment thereupon, containing an Obligement for Payment and releif of the ſaid Sums.</p>
                     <p>Thereafter the ſaid Mr. <hi>Patrick</hi> did obtain, from his Father, a Right and Infeftment of the ſaid Lands, upon that narrative, that he had undertaken the payment of his Fathers Debts; and that he was engaged for him; and that the ſaid Right was granted to him for his Relief; whereupon he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Poſſeſſion; and, before any Diligence, at the inſtance of any of the other Creditors, he did pay ſome Annualrent to <hi>Cramond</hi> upon a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, relateing to <hi>Cramonds</hi> Right and Infeftment foreſaid.</p>
                     <p>Thereafter there being a Multiple poinding raiſed againſt <hi>Cramond,</hi> and ſome of the Creditors, who had deduced a Compryſing againſt the ſaid Mr. <hi>Patrick</hi> of his Right; the Creditors <hi>Alledged,</hi> that they ought to be preferred, becauſe <hi>Cramonds</hi> Right was only baſe, and the ſaid Mr. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s Right was cled with Poſſeſſion, before any pretence of Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the perſon of <hi>Cramond;</hi> and that they having Compryſed Mr. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick</hi>'s Right are thereupon preferable to <hi>Cramond;</hi> Whereunto it was <hi>Anſwered,</hi> That <hi>Cramonds</hi> Right, being a Right of Relief, could not take Poſſeſſion <hi>ex natura</hi> of the Right, until a diſtreſs; and becauſe it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided by the Right it ſelf, that <hi>Cramond</hi> ſhould enter to the Poſſeſſion in caſe of diſtreſs; and in caſe he ſhould not be payed of his Annualrent; which he could not do before Declarator: And that the <hi>Lords</hi> had diverſe times <hi>Found,</hi> that Infeftments of Warrandice, whereupon there could be no Poſſeſſion before Eviction, ſhould be preferred to poſterior Infeft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and that Infeftments of Annualrent, being anterior, ſhould be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained in a Competition with poſterior baſe Infeftments cled with Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion; Becauſe the firſt Term of Payment of the Annualrent was not come, when the poſterior Infeftment came to have Poſſeſſion; and that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition was not betwixt <hi>Cramonds</hi> and the Compryſers Infeftment upon the Compryſing, but Mr. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s own Infeftment; and that <hi>Cramonds</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feftment was cled with Poſſeſſion before the Compyſers Right and Intereſt, by payment of the Annualrent of the ſaid Sum due to <hi>Cramond</hi> himſelf; as appeared by the Diſcharge accepted by Mr. <hi>Patrick</hi> relating to <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> his Right and Infeftment foreſaid: And that baſe Infeftments by the Common Law being valide; And by the Act of Parliament <hi>K. Ja.</hi> 5th. <hi>in anno</hi> 1540. It being provided, that for obviating Fraud by granting
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:94635:237"/>
private and latent Infeftments, in prejudice of poſterior Infeftments that are publick, being either holden of the Superior or by Poſſeſſion; the ſaid Act of Parliament cannot be extended to this Caſe; In Reſpect <hi>Cramonds</hi> Right cannot be ſaid to have been fraudulent and private as to Mr. <hi>Patrick;</hi> In reſpect he did not only know the ſame, but did ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify and corroborate the ſaid Right as ſaid is, both before his own Right and after the ſame; and before the intereſt of Creditors, he did in effect ratify and homologate the ſame, by making payment conform thereto, as ſaid is.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Lords,</hi> In Reſpect the caſe was of moment, as to the Preparative, Ordained that it ſhould be Debated amongſt themſelves: And upon the Debate, they decided theſe points. 1. That, the ſaid Act of Parliament <hi>K. Ja.</hi> 5th. being general, and there being no Exceptions of Infeftments of Relief, the ſaid Act is comprehenſive of the ſame. 2. Tho the Act of Parliament, anent Regiſtration of Seaſings, does ſecure Singular Succeſſors, yet the ſaid Act of Parliament <hi>K. Ja.</hi> 5th. is not taken away, tho in in ſome caſes, the <hi>Lords</hi> are apt to favour prior Infeftments, where there is no preſumption of Fraud: And therefore, when there is any pretence of Poſſeſſion, as in the caſe of Infeftments of Warrandice, they <hi>Found</hi> that <hi>fictione Juris</hi> the Poſſeſſion of the principal Lands is the poſſeſſion of the Warrandice. 3. That albeit Mr. <hi>Patrick</hi> could not queſtion <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds</hi> Right for the Reaſon foreſaid, yet the Compryſers, being Singular Succeſſors, may queſtion the ſame.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Lords</hi> therefore preferred the Creditors: And yet ſuſtained <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds</hi> Infeftment, In ſwa far as concerns the Sum foreſaid due to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and not as to Cautionries; In reſpect the ſaid Diſcharge was only of the Annualrent of the Sum due to himſelf.</p>
                     <p>This Deciſion appears to be hard, upon theſe Conſiderations: <hi>Firſt,</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Cramonds</hi> Infeftment, tho baſe, as to the point of Right, by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law is preferable: And as to the ſaid Statute, it introduces only a <hi>praeſumptio Juris,</hi> that baſe Infeftments, not cled with Poſſeſſion, are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptively fraudulent: And the Queſtion, whether <hi>Cramonds</hi> Infeftment was fraudulent, was to be conſidered in relation to Mr. <hi>Patrick</hi> and his Infeftment, and not to his Succeſſors: And the ſaid preſumption was taken away by Mr. <hi>Patrick</hi> his Deed foreſaid, having corroborate, as ſaid is, <hi>Cramonds</hi> Infeftment; which was verified by a Write Subſcribed by Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and which was was <hi>Found</hi> to militate, even againſt the Creditors, and to cloath <hi>Cramonds</hi> Infeftment with <hi>Poſſeſſion.</hi> 2. <hi>Cramonds</hi> Right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Jus individuum,</hi> tho upon diſtinct Grounds, it could not be fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and private <hi>ex parte,</hi> and <hi>ex parte</hi> publick.
